   abstract = {This article examines the increasingly crucial role played by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in the analysis, design, certification, and support of aerospace products. The status of CFD is described, and we identify opportunities for CFD to have a more substantial impact. The challenges facing CFD are also discussed, primarily in terms of numerical solution, computing power, and physical modelling. We believe the community must find a balance between enthusiasm and rigor. Besides becoming faster and more affordable by exploiting higher computing power, CFD needs to become more reliable, more reproducible across users, and better understood and integrated with other disciplines and engineering processes. Uncertainty quantification is universally considered as a major goal, but will be slow to take hold. The prospects are good for steady problems with Reynolds-Averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS) turbulence modelling to be solved accurately and without user intervention within a decade â€" even for very complex geometries, provided technologies, such as solution adaptation are matured for large three-dimensional problems. On the other hand, current projections for supercomputers show a future rate of growth only half of the rate enjoyed from the 1990s to 2013; true exaflop performance is not close. This will delay pure Large- Eddy Simulation (LES) for aerospace applications with their high Reynolds numbers, but hybrid RANS-LES approaches have great potential. Our expectations for a breakthrough in turbulence, whether within traditional modelling or LES, are low and as a result offdesign flow physics including separation will continue to pose a substantial challenge, as will laminar-turbulent transition. We also advocate for much improved user interfaces, providing instant access to rich numerical and physical information as well as warnings over solution quality, and thus naturally training the user.},

   abstract = {We investigate the main challenges to prediction of turbulent external flows of practical interest with Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) and Scale-Resolving Simulation (SRS) models. This represents a crucial step toward further developing and establishing these formulations so they can be confidently utilized in engineering problems without reference data. The study initiates by identifying the major challenges to prediction. A literature review is performed to illustrate their effects in RANS and SRS computations. Afterward, we evaluate the impact of the challenges to prediction by analyzing representative statistically steady and unsteady flows with prominent RANS and SRS methods. These include multiple turbulent viscosity and second-moment RANS closures, and hybrid and bridging SRS models. The results demonstrate the potential of the selected SRS models to predict engineering flows. Yet, they also show the importance of considering the challenges to prediction during the setup and conduction of numerical experiments. These can suppress the advantages of using SRS formulations. The data also indicate that only SRS models can confidently predict statistically unsteady flows. In contrast, the results demonstrate that mean-flow quantities of statistically steady flows can be efficiently calculated with RANS closures, especially second-moment closures. Among the selected SRS methods, bridging models reveal better suited for prediction due to their ability to prevent commutation errors and enable the robust evaluation of numerical and modeling errors. This last property allows the use of a new validation technique that does not require reference data.},

    abstract = { A data-driven approach to predict dynamic responses of mistuned cyclic dynamic structures is presented. Nominally cyclic structures such as turbomachinery bladed disks, or blisks, contain deviations from perfect symmetry, called mistuning, which can significantly increase the forced response of the structure subject to periodic excitations. The ability to accurately model the response is crucial for understanding a structure’s dynamics during operation, and thus many reduced-order models have been developed. Data-driven approaches, however, are largely unexplored for predicting physical responses of cyclic structures, and are desirable due to their ability to leverage both computational and experimental data. In this paper, two feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are trained using physical responses and parameters from an individual sector of the cyclic structure. The desired physical responses of all sectors are predicted via a cyclic coupling procedure. By only using sector-level data, the number of simulations and/or experiments required to generate training data is substantially reduced, and the approach is not restricted to a specific projection basis unlike previous physics-based methods. A lumped mass model (LMM) of a blisk with stiffness mistuning is used to generate computational surrogate data for training and validation. Both FFNNs achieve high prediction accuracy on both training data and unseen test data. For a test case with an unseen mistuning pattern, this approach shows strong agreement with known actual responses. For this test case, prediction errors in the LMM blade tip amplitudes across all sectors are less than 2\%, and the amplification factor error is less than 0.2\%. }

Model order reduction (MOR) is an efficient way to address those problems and widely applied in the engineering areas. This paper focuses on the model order reduction of high-dimensional complex systems and reviews basic theories, well-posedness, and limitations of common methods of the model order reduction using the following methods: center manifold, Lyapunov-Schmidt (L-S), Galerkin, modal synthesis, and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) methods. The POD is a powerful and effective model order reduction method, which aims at obtaining the most important components of a high-dimensional complex system by using a few proper orthogonal modes, and it is widely studied and applied by a large number of researchers in the past few decades. In this paper, the POD method is introduced in detail and the main characteristics and the existing problems of this method are also discussed. POD is classified into two categories in terms of the sampling and the parameter robustness, and the research progresses in the recent years are presented to the domestic researchers for the study and application. Finally, the outlooks of model order reduction of high-dimensional complex systems are provided for future work.},

   abstract = {From aircraft design to certification, a significant volume of aerodynamic data is required to ensure optimal performance, meet regulatory standards, and maintain structural integrity. These data must span the entire flight envelope, encompassing pressure and shear stress distributions, global coefficients, and derivatives. Traditionally sourced from flight tests, wind tunnel experiments, or numerical simulations, the data are often of varying fidelity, ranging from handbook methods to high-resolution simulations. In recent years, the demand for efficient use of these data has grown, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, enabling the development of fast-running surrogate models. Unlike traditional high-fidelity simulations or experimental setups, which can be resource-intensive, surrogate models trained on these data sets deliver rapid predictions comparable to database queries. The AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Surrogate Modeling (AASM) group was formed to bring focus to data-driven and AI modeling in aerospace sciences, uniting experts from academia, industry, and government agencies worldwide. The AASM group prioritizes the development, accuracy, and applicability of surrogate modeling for aerospace applications, including design optimization, uncertainty quantification, systems engineering, and mission analysis—all critical to a digital engineering ecosystem. To support evaluation and comparison of methodologies, this paper introduces four benchmark cases: an aerodynamic database of integrated airfoil performance coefficients, a missile case for 6DOF generation, and two data sets focusing on surface pressure distributions. These benchmarks highlight associated surrogate modeling challenges and will be made publicly available through AIAA, offering valuable resources for the aerospace community.},

   abstract = {Full scale aerodynamic wind tunnel testing, numerical simulation of high dimensional (full-order) aerodynamic models or flight testing are some of the fundamental but complex steps in the various design phases of recent civil transport aircrafts. Current aircraft aerodynamic designs have increase in complexity (multidisciplinary, multi-objective or multi-fidelity) and need to address the challenges posed by the nonlinearity of the objective functions and constraints, uncertainty quantification in aerodynamic problems or the restrained computational budgets. With the aim to reduce the computational burden and generate low-cost but accurate models that mimic those full order models at different values of the design variables, Recent progresses have witnessed the introduction, in real-time and many-query analyses, of surrogate-based approaches as rapid and cheaper to simulate models. In this paper, a comprehensive and state-of-the art survey on common surrogate modeling techniques and surrogate-based optimization methods is given, with an emphasis on models selection and validation, dimensionality reduction, sensitivity analyses, constraints handling or infill and stopping criteria. Benefits, drawbacks and comparative discussions in applying those methods are described. Furthermore, the paper familiarizes the readers with surrogate models that have been successfully applied to the general field of fluid dynamics, but not yet in the aerospace industry. Additionally, the review revisits the most popular sampling strategies used in conducting physical and simulation-based experiments in aircraft aerodynamic design. Attractive or smart designs infrequently used in the field and discussions on advanced sampling methodologies are presented, to give a glance on the various efficient possibilities to a priori sample the parameter space. Closing remarks foster on future perspectives, challenges and shortcomings associated with the use of surrogate models by aircraft industrial aerodynamicists, despite their increased interest among the research communities.},

   abstract = {The aerodynamic shape optimization of wings in transonic flow is an inherently challenging problem. In addition to the high computational cost of solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, there is a complex interdependence between the cross-sectional shape, wave drag, and viscous effects. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform multipoint optimizations to ensure good performance for a range of flight conditions. The choice of which flight conditions should be considered in a multipoint optimization and how many of these should be considered is still not well understood. This paper addresses this issue by solving a series of seven benchmark optimizations developed by the AIAA Aerodynamic Optimization Discussion Group. These optimization cases include a single-point optimization, four three-point optimizations, a nine-point optimization, and a five-point optimization. The optimizations consist in minimizing the weighted drag coefficient subject to lift, moment, thickness, and volume constraints. The optimizations were performed with respect to 768 shape design variables and an angle of attack for each flight condition. The single-point optimization was able to achieve an 8.1% drag reduction relative to the initial design, but it exhibited poor off-design performance. All the optimized designs were compared using a contour plot of ML/cD to evaluate the wing performance over the complete transonic flight operating envelope. Each of the four three-point optimizations successfully mitigated the poor off-design performance of the single-point design. However, the three-point optimization with widely spaced Mach numbers yielded a much more complexML/cD contour with two distinct local maxima. Finally, the five- and nine-point optimizations yielded similar performance and the most robust off-design performance.},

These studies demonstrate that neural networks are effective approaches to aerodynamic data modeling. Finally, we identify three important trends for future studies in aerodynamic data modeling: a) the transformation method and physics informed models will be combined to solve high-dimensional partial differential equations; b) in the research area of steady aerodynamic response predictions, model-oriented studies and data-integration-oriented studies will become the future research directions, while in unsteady aerodynamic response predictions, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are the best tools for capturing the nonlinear characteristics of flow data, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are expected to replace long short-term memories (LSTMs) to capture the temporal characteristics of flow data; and c) in the field of steady or unsteady flow field reconstructions, the CNN-based conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) will be the best frameworks in which to discover the spatiotemporal distribution of flow field data.},

   abstract = {The aircraft conceptual design step requires a substantial number of aerodynamic configuration evaluations. Since the wing is the main aircraft lifting element, the focus is on solving direct and reverse design problems. The former could be solved using a low-cost computational model, but the latter is unlikely, even for these models. Surrogate modeling is a technique for simplifying complex models that reduces computational time. In this work, a surrogate aerodynamic model, based on the implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is presented. The input data consist of geometrical characteristics of the wing and airfoil and flight conditions. Some of the MLP hyperparameters are defined using evolutionary algorithms, learning curves, and cross-validation methods. The MLP predicts the aerodynamic coefficients (drag, lift, and pitching moment) with high agreement with the substituted aerodynamic model. The MLP can predict the aerodynamic characteristics of compressible flow up to 0.6 M. The developed MLP has achieved up to almost 800 times faster in computing time than the model on which it was trained. The application of the developed MLP will enable the rapid study of the effects of changes in various parameters and flight conditions on flight performance, related to the design and modernization of new vehicles.},
