abstract = {In the early stage of aircraft engine design, the through-flow method is an important tool for designers. The accuracy of the through-flow method depends heavily on the accuracy of the loss model. However, most existing models cannot (or cannot well) provide the spanwise loss distribution. To construct an effective spanwise loss model, both turbomachinery knowledge and machine learning skills were used in this paper. A large number of numerical simulations were carried out to build a database containing more than 1000 compressor cascade numerical samples. Secondary flow intensity was introduced as the independent variable to carry out feature engineering. A model containing a selector based on support vector machine regression and estimators based on K-nearest neighbor regression was constructed. Numerical test set and design data of two former high-pressure core compressors were used for validation. Results suggest that the spanwise loss model show good consistency with both numerical test set and data of two former compressors. It can reflect the influence of secondary flow and can also predict both value and trend of total pressure loss coefficient well, with mean absolute error general around or less than 1{\%} and R2 (coefficient of determination) more than 0.8 on the test set. Especially when dealing with loss coefficient at mid-span position, the model shows even better performance, with R2 over 0.97 on the test set. And the selector of the model can well classify the samples, predict the intensity of secondary flow and help estimators to capture the phenomenon that end-wall secondary flow extends to the mid-span.},

@article{Ali2021b,
abstract = {A data-driven approach is an alternative to extract general models for wind energy applications. A spatial sensitivity analysis is achieved using a probabilistic model to quantitatively identify the variability in performance due to individual parameters and visualize spatial distributions. Proper orthogonal decomposition results are combined with linear discriminant analysis under the clustering framework to present low-dimensional classifiers. Using the decomposition enables the system to be far away from ill-conditioned states. The optimal sensor locations are explicitly distributed in the transition region, where the velocity and Reynolds stresses relax toward a wake recovered state. With the optimal sensors, the cluster assignment and flow dynamics are obtained. There is an advantage in including more features in the reconstruction process to capture the slow and fast dynamics. Assessing the differences in the wake response and establishing the importance of spatial sensitivities are provided here for seeking accurate models. The bidirectional neural network is used to predict the fluctuating velocity of the considered sensors. The result of long-short term memory shows correlations of 92{\%} between the real and predicted fluctuating velocities.},

abstract = {Sandia National Laboratories is investigating advanced Brayton cycles using supercritical working fluids for use with solar, nuclear or fossil heat sources. The focus of this work has been on the supercritical CO2 cycle (S-CO2) which has the potential for high efficiency in the temperature range of interest for these heat sources, and is also very compact, with the potential for lower capital costs. The first step in the development of these advanced cycles was the construction of a small scale Brayton cycle loop, funded by the Laboratory Directed Research {\&} Development program, to study the key issue of compression near the critical point of CO2. This document outlines the design of the small scale loop, describes the major components, presents models of system performance, including losses, leakage, windage, compressor performance, and flow map predictions, and finally describes the experimental results that have been generated.},

abstract = {Advances in sensor technology have increased our ability to monitor a wide range of environments. However, even as the cost of sensors decline, only a limited number of sensors can be installed at any given site. The physical placement of sensors, along with the sensor technology and operating conditions, can have a large impact on our ability to adequately monitor environmental change. This paper introduces a new open-source Python package, called Chama, that determines optimal sensor placement and technology to improve a sensor network's detection capabilities. The methods are demonstrated using site-specific methane emission scenarios that capture uncertainty in wind conditions and emission characteristics. Mixed-integer linear programming formulations are used to determine sensor locations and detection thresholds that maximize detection of the emission scenarios. The optimized sensor networks consistently increase the ability to detect leaks, as compared to sensors placed near each potential emission source or along the perimeter of the site.},

@article{Sekar2019,
abstract = {In this paper, a data driven approach is presented for the prediction of incompressible laminar steady flow field over airfoils based on the combination of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deep Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The flow field over an airfoil depends on the airfoil geometry, Reynolds number, and angle of attack. In conventional approaches, Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved on a computational mesh with corresponding boundary conditions to obtain the flow solutions, which is a time consuming task. In the present approach, the flow field over an airfoil is approximated as a function of airfoil geometry, Reynolds number, and angle of attack using deep neural networks without solving the NS equations. The present approach consists of two steps. First, CNN is employed to extract the geometrical parameters from airfoil shapes. Then, the extracted geometrical parameters along with Reynolds number and angle of attack are fed as input to the MLP network to obtain an approximate model to predict the flow field. The required database for the network training is generated using the OpenFOAM solver by solving NS equations. Once the training is done, the flow field around an airfoil can be obtained in seconds. From the prediction results, it is evident that the approach is efficient and accurate.},

We model the sources using a binary function, and we show that the inverse problem can be formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem. We show empirically that current state-of-the-art mixed-integer solvers cannot solve this problem and that applying simple rounding heuristics to solutions of the relaxed problem can fail to identify the correct number and location of the sources. We develop two new rounding heuristics that exploit the value and a physical interpretation of the continuous relaxation solution, and we apply a steepest-descent improvement heuristic to obtain satisfactory solutions to both two- and three-dimensional inverse problems. We also provide the code used in our numerical experiments in open-source format.},

@article{Yu2019c,
abstract = {Multidimensional aerodynamic database development has become more and more important for the design, control, and guidance of modern aircraft. To relieve the curse of the dimensionality, a novel flowfield reconstruction method based on an artificial neural network is proposed. The idea is to design a simplified problem that is related to the target problem. Then, the map from the simplified problem to the target problem is built using an artificial neural network. Finally, the target problem can be predicted efficiently through solving the simplified problem instead. Examples of the efficiency of this approach include two-dimensional viscous nozzle flows, an inviscid M6 wing flow, a viscous hypersonic flow of a complex configuration, and an unsteady two-dimensional Riemann problem to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A Gaussian process model is also incorporated for a comparative study. With an artificial neural network of moderate complexity, the solution of the target problem can be generated with good accuracy. Among other observations, it is found that shocks can be predicted well with sharp resolution for steady and unsteady cases. Overall, using a simplified problem that accounts for all the interested parameters as inputs tends to be more reliable than using input parameters.},

abstract = {A supercritical CO2test facility is currently being developed at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India to analyze the performance of a closed loop Brayton cycle for concentrated solar power (CSP) generation. The loop has been designed for an external heat input of 20 k W, a pressure range of 75-135 bar, flow rate of 11 kg/min, and a maximum cycle temperature of 525 °C. The operation of the loop and the various parametric tests planned to be performed are discussed in this paper. The paper addresses various aspects of the loop design with emphasis on design of various components such as regenerator and expansion device. The regenerator design is critical due to sharp property variations in CO2occurring during the heat exchange process between the hot and cold streams. Two types of heat exchanger configurations 1) tube-in-tube (TITHE) and 2) printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) are analyzed and compared. A PCHE is found to be ∼5 times compact compared to a TITHE for identical heat transfer and pressure drops. The expansion device is being custom designed to achieve the desired pressure drop for a range of operating temperatures. It is found that capillary of 5.5 mm inner diameter and ∼2 meter length is sufficient to achieve a pressure drop from 130 to 75 bar at a maximum cycle temperature of 525 °C.},

abstract = {A quadratic approximation manifold is presented for performing nonlinear, projection-based, model order reduction (PMOR). It constitutes a departure from the traditional affine subspace approximation that is aimed at mitigating the Kolmogorov barrier for nonlinear PMOR, particularly for convection-dominated transport problems. It builds on the data-driven approach underlying the traditional construction of projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs); is application-independent; is linearization-free; and therefore is robust for highly nonlinear problems. Most importantly, this approximation leads to quadratic PROMs that deliver the same accuracy as their traditional counterparts using however a much smaller dimension – typically, n2∼n1, where n2 and n1 denote the dimensions of the quadratic and traditional PROMs, respectively. The computational advantages of the proposed high-order approach to nonlinear PMOR over the traditional approach are highlighted for the detached-eddy simulation-based prediction of the Ahmed body turbulent wake flow, which is a popular CFD benchmark problem in the automotive industry. For a fixed accuracy level, these advantages include: a reduction of the total offline computational cost by a factor greater than five; a reduction of its online wall clock time by a factor greater than 32; and a reduction of the wall clock time of the underlying high-dimensional model by a factor greater than two orders of magnitude.},

In this paper, an innovative hybrid wind speed forecasting model, including fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition, sample entropy, phase space reconstruction and back-propagation neural network with two hidden layers, is proposed to enhance the accuracy of wind speed prediction. The data is firstly preprocessed by fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy. Subsequently, the prediction model called improved back-propagation neural network is built to forecast the sub-series, whose inputs and outputs are obtained in accordance to phase space reconstruction. To verify the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed model, the paper chooses the real data from two wind farms located in different site in China for experiments. Comparing with the benchmark models, the proposed model shows a better performance in short-term wind speed forecasting.},

abstract = {As a reaction to the increasing market dynamics and complex requirements, today's products need to be developed quickly and customized to the customer's individual needs. In the past, CAD systems are mainly used to visualize the model that the product designer creates. Generative Design shifts the task of the CAD program by actively participating in the shaping process. This results in more design options and the complexity of the shapes and geometries increases significantly. This potential can be optimally exploited through the combination of Generative Design with Additive Manufacturing (AM). Artificial intelligence and the input of target parameters generate geometries, for example, by creating material for stressed areas, which in turn develops biomorphic shapes and thus significantly reduces the consumption of resources. This contribution aims at the evaluation of existing applications in CAD systems for generative design. Special attention is paid to the requirements in design education and easy access for students. For this purpose, three representative CAD systems are selected and analyzed with the help of a comprehensive example of mass reduction. The aim is to perform an individual result analysis in order to assess the application based on various criteria. By using different materials, the influence of the material for the generation is investigated by comparing the material distribution. By comparing the generated models, differences of the CAD systems can be identified and possible fields of application can be presented. By specifying the manufacturing parameters for the generation of the models, the feasibility of AM can be guaranteed without having to modify the results. The physical implementation of the example by means of Fused Deposition Modeling demonstrates this in an exemplary way and examines the interface of the Generative Design and AM. The results of this contribution will enable an evaluation of the different CAD systems for Generative Design according to technical, visual and economic aspects.},

abstract = {We address the problem of data augmentation in a rotating turbulence set-up, a paradigmatic challenge in geophysical applications. The goal is to reconstruct information in two-dimensional (2D) cuts of the three-dimensional flow fields, imagining spatial gaps present within each 2D observed slice. We evaluate the effectiveness of different data-driven tools, based on diffusion models (DMs), a state-of-the-art generative machine learning protocol, and generative adversarial networks (GANs), previously considered as the best-performing method both in terms of point-wise reconstruction and the statistical properties of the inferred velocity fields. We focus on two different DMs recently proposed in the specialized literature: (i) RePaint, based on a heuristic strategy to guide an unconditional DM for flow generation by using partial measurements data, and (ii) Palette, a conditional DM trained for the reconstruction task with paired measured and missing data. Systematic comparison shows that (i) DMs outperform the GAN in terms of the mean squared error and/or the statistical accuracy; (ii) Palette DM emerges as the most promising tool in terms of both point-wise and statistical metrics. An important property of DMs is their capacity for probabilistic reconstructions, providing a range of predictions based on the same measurements, enabling uncertainty quantification and risk assessment.},

abstract = {Rotating stall waves that travel against the direction of rotor rotation are reported for the first time and a new, low-order analytical approach to model centrifugal compressor stability is introduced. The model is capable of dealing with unsteady radially swirling flows and the dynamic effects of impeller-diffuser component interaction as it occurs in centrifugal compression systems. A simple coupling criterion is developed from first principles to explain the interaction mechanism important for system stability. The model findings together with experimental data explain the mechanism for first-ever observed backward traveling rotating stall in centrifugal compressors with vaned diffusers. Based on the low-order model predictions, an air injection scheme between the impeller and the vaned diffuser is designed for the NASA Glenn CC3 high-speed centrifugal compressor. The steady air injection experiments show an increase of 25{\%} in surge-margin with an injection mass flow of 0.5{\%} of the compressor mass flow. In addition, it is experimentally demonstrated that this injection scheme is robust to impeller tip-clearance effects and that a reduced number of injectors can be applied for similar gains in surge-margin. The results presented in this paper firmly establish the connection between the experimentally observed dynamic phenomena in the NASA CC3 centrifugal compressor and a first principles based coupling criterion. In addition, guidelines are given for the design of centrifugal compressors with enhanced stability. {\textcopyright} 2004 by ASME.},

abstract = {Operator regression provides a powerful means of constructing discretization-invariant emulators for partial-differential equations (PDEs) describing physical systems. Neural operators specifically employ deep neural networks to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. As data-driven models, neural operators require the generation of labeled observations, which in cases of complex high-fidelity models result in high-dimensional datasets containing redundant and noisy features, which can hinder gradient-based optimization. Mapping these high-dimensional datasets to a low-dimensional latent space of salient features can make it easier to work with the data and also enhance learning. In this work, we investigate the latent deep operator network (L-DeepONet), an extension of standard DeepONet, which leverages latent representations of high-dimensional PDE input and output functions identified with suitable autoencoders. We illustrate that L-DeepONet outperforms the standard approach in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency across diverse time-dependent PDEs, e.g., modeling the growth of fracture in brittle materials, convective fluid flows, and large-scale atmospheric flows exhibiting multiscale dynamical features.},

abstract = {We present a hp-inverse model to estimate a smooth, non-negative source function from a limited number of observations for a two-dimensional linear source inversion problem. A standard least-square inverse model is formulated by using a set of Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBF) on a rectangular mesh system with a uniform grid space. Here, the choice of the mesh system is modeled as a random variable and the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion is used to represent the random mesh system. It is shown that the convolution of gPC and GRBF provides hierarchical basis functions for the linear source inverse model with the hp-refinement capability. We propose a mixed l1 and l2 regularization to exploit the hierarchical nature of the basis functions to find a sparse solution. The hp-inverse model has an advantage over the standard least-square inverse model when the number of data is limited. It is shown that the hp-inverse model provides a good estimate of the source function even when the number of unknown parameters (m) is much larger the number of data (n), e.g., m∕n{\textgreater}40.},

abstract = {This paper presents a supervised learning method for the physical field reconstruction in a specific heat transfer problem. The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to predict fields from a few measurable information, while heat transfer characteristics of interest can be then easily inferred from the fields. This data-driven method can establish an end to end mapping from low-dimensional measurable information to full physical fields. Two modes of measurable information are considered as inputs of the network. When the measurable information is an accurate structure or work condition parameters, this method is equivalent as an efficient surrogate model instead of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. This network can also reconstruct the full-field from local information with several measuring points as inputs. To our best knowledge, this is the first time a CNN based model has been used as a high-fidelity field predicator for the flow heat transfer. To validate this method, the fields of Al2O3-water nanofluid laminar flow in a grooved microchannel are employed to be reconstructed from a set of reduced parameters. It indicates that the reconstruction model enables accurate results for all the temperature, velocity and pressure fields. Meanwhile, the characteristics concerned in a heat transfer process, such as Nu and f, can also be extracted from the reconstructed fields with high precision. Furthermore, the reconstruction performance and stability are verified from several perspectives, including the loss function, train-data size, measuring noise and points layout. At last, the comparison of computational costs shows that a well-trained CNN model has three orders of magnitude faster than CFD solver. The proposed approach can provide an efficient analysis tool with acceptable accuracy for heat transfer research.},

The distributed viscous body force can be calculated either using a very simple viscous wall shear stress model or extracted from a 'stand-alone' three-dimensional single passage steady calculation using a fine mesh. By eliminating the need to compute fine viscous scales, the proposed method is several orders of magnitude more efficient than 'standard' fine mesh N-S unsteady calculations while maintaining respectable resolution down to the scale of blade-to-blade variation, including wake/potential interactions between blade rows.

abstract = {Fast and accurate prediction of high-speed flowfields is of particular interest to researchers in fluid science and engineering to enable efficient design exploration and knowledge discovery. The reliability of prediction is another important metric for the performance of prediction models. While predictive modeling approaches with and without reduced-order modeling (ROM) via machine learning techniques have been proposed, they are inherently subject to loss of information for ROM-based approaches and substantial computational costs in modeling for non-ROM-based approaches. This paper proposes an accurate ROM-based predictive framework with minimum information loss enabled by incorporating Gaussian process latent variable modeling (GPLVM) and deep learning. The stochastic nature of GPLVM allows for uncertainty quantification that indicates the degree of prediction error or reliability of prediction without requiring validation data. The applicability for supersonic/hypersonic viscous flowfields has been examined for two cases including axisymmetric intakes and two-dimensional fuel injection in scramjet engines by comparison with other predictive models. Comparable or superior prediction accuracy over the other models has been achieved by the proposed approaches, demonstrating its high potential to serve as a new competent, data-driven technique for fast, accurate, and reliable prediction of scramjet flowfields.},

The adaptive ROM is formulated in a Least-Squares setting using a variable transformation to promote stability and robustness. An efficient strategy is developed to incorporate non-local information in the basis adaptation, significantly enhancing the predictive capabilities of the resulting ROMs. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is presented, and validated. The adaptive ROM formulation is shown to require negligible offline training and naturally enables both future-state and parametric predictions. The formulation is evaluated on representative reacting flow benchmark problems, demonstrating that the ROMs are capable of providing efficient and accurate predictions including those involving significant changes in dynamics due to parametric variations, and transient phenomena.

In contrast, neural networks have achieved amazing levels of accuracy on image recognition and natural language processing tasks, but they are often seen as black-box models that are difficult to interpret and typically extrapolate poorly. In this article, we use a neural network-based architecture for symbolic regression called the equation learner (EQL) network and integrate it with other deep learning architectures such that the whole system can be trained end-to-end through backpropagation. To demonstrate the power of such systems, we study their performance on several substantially different tasks. First, we show that the neural network can perform symbolic regression and learn the form of several functions. Next, we present an MNIST arithmetic task where a convolutional network extracts the digits. Finally, we demonstrate the prediction of dynamical systems where an unknown parameter is extracted through an encoder. We find that the EQL-based architecture can extrapolate quite well outside of the training data set compared with a standard neural network-based architecture, paving the way for deep learning to be applied in scientific exploration and discovery.},

abstract = {The performance of a classifier in a brain-computer interface (BCI) system is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data. Typically, the training data are collected in a laboratory where the users perform tasks in a controlled environment. However, users' attention may be diverted in real-life BCI applications and this may decrease the performance of the classifier. To improve the robustness of the classifier, additional data can be acquired in such conditions, but it is not practical to record electroencephalogram (EEG) data over several long calibration sessions. A potentially time- and cost-efficient solution is artificial data generation. Hence, in this study, we proposed a framework based on the deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for generating artificial EEG to augment the training set in order to improve the performance of a BCI classifier. To make a comparative investigation, we designed a motor task experiment with diverted and focused attention conditions. We used an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network for classification between movement intention and rest using the data from 14 subjects. The results from the leave-one subject-out (LOO) classification yielded baseline accuracies of 73.04{\%} for diverted attention and 80.09{\%} for focused attention without data augmentation. Using the proposed DCGANs-based framework for augmentation, the results yielded a significant improvement of 7.32{\%} for diverted attention ( {\$}p {\textless} 0.01{\$} ) and 5.45{\%} for focused attention ( {\$}p {\textless} 0.01{\$} ). In addition, we implemented the method on the data set IVa from BCI competition III to distinguish different motor imagery tasks. The proposed method increased the accuracy by 3.57{\%} ( {\$}p {\textless} 0.02{\$} ). This study shows that using GANs for EEG augmentation can significantly improve BCI performance, especially in real-life applications, whereby users' attention may be diverted.},

The model designed is to demonstrate that the deep neural network can realize the reconstruction and prediction of the flow field structure in the supersonic cascade channel under complicated and changing working conditions. The dataset used for model training is derived from numerical simulation of the supersonic cascade channel. The symmetrical model includes a transposed convolution part and a conventional convolution part, which, respectively, implement up-sampling of the pressure data and further extraction of features. The generalization ability and scalability of the model are analyzed from the contour plots of the pressure and density gradient. In order to verify the ability of the model to reconstruct unknown operating conditions, the organizational form of the training set and testing set has been specially designed to achieve the ability of interpolating outwards. In the testing set, the symmetrical model has a certain ability to realize extrapolation and prediction, and the flow field structure can be accurately reconstructed by using the discrete pressure values on the wall surface of the cascade channel. Moreover, to accurately evaluate the regression model proposed by this study, the correlation analysis was also applied in this study. The results show that the worst linear correlation coefficient is 0.9848 in the testing set, indicating that the model has satisfactory ability to reconstruct and predict the flow field.},

abstract = {Breaking down the total loss in a turbomachine into a number of low-order, physical models is a powerful way of developing loss models for informing design decisions. Better loss models lead to better design decisions. A problem, however, is that in complex flows, it is often not clear how to break a flow down physically without making assumptions. An additional problem is that the designer often does not know what assumptions should be made to derive the most accurate and general physical models. In practice, this problem often leads to loss models of low accuracy, which only work in a limited part of the overall design space. This paper shows that machine learning can be used to augment a designer in the process of developing loss models for complex flows. It is shown that it is able to help a designer discover new, more accurate and general, physical models, highlighting to a designer what assumptions should be made to retain the physics important to the problem. The paper illustrates the new method using the problem of compressor and turbine profile loss. This problem was chosen because it is well understood and therefore is a good way of validating the new method. However, surprisingly the new method is shown to be able to develop a new profile loss model which is more accurate and general than previous models. This is shown to have been achieved by the machine learning finding a new, more general, underlying model for trailing edge mixing loss.},

This work contributes to the growing trend in machine-learning for modelling physical phenomena. Our framework is shown to be computational inexpensive and produce accurate and robust models that are tangible mathematical expressions. This transparency in the result allows us to diagnose issues with the regressed formulae and appropriately make amendments, as we further understand the regression tools. Such models are created using hybrid RANS/LES flow field data and a passive solving of the RANS transport equations to obtain the modelled time scale. This process shows that models can be regressed from a qualitatively correct flow field and fully resolved DNS is not necessarily required. Models are trained and tested using rectangular ducts, an example flow genus that linear RANS models even qualitatively fail to predict correctly. A priori and a posteriori testing of the new models show that the framework is a viable methodology for RANS closure development. This a posteriori agenda includes testing on an asymmetric diffuser, for which the new models vastly outperform the baseline linear model. Therefore this study presents one of the most rigorous and complete CFD validation of machine learnt turbulent stress models to date.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computational model for simulating axial compressor stall inception and development via disturbances with length scales on the order of several (typically about three) blade pitches. The model was designed for multistage compressors in which stall is initiated by these "short-wavelength" disturbances, also referred to as spikes. The inception process described is fundamentally nonlinear, in contrast to the essentially linear behavior seen in so-called "modal stall inception. " The model was able to capture the following experimentally observed phenomena: (1) development of rotating stall via short-wavelength disturbances, (2) formation and evolution of localized short-wavelength stall cells in the first-stage of a mismatched compressor, (3) the switch from long to short-wavelength stall inception resulting from the re-staggering of the inlet guide vane, (4) the occurrence of rotating stall inception on the negatively sloped portion of the compressor characteristic. Parametric investigations indicated that: (I) short-wavelength disturbances were supported by the rotor blade row, (2) the disturbance strength was attenuated within the stators, and (3) the reduction of inter-blade row gaps can suppress the growth of short-wavelength disturbances. It is argued that each local component group (rotor plus neighboring stators) has its own instability point (i.e., conditions at which disturbances are sustained) for short-wavelength disturbances, with the instability point for the compressor set by the most unstable component group. {\textcopyright} 1999 ASME.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained using the conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. However, SGD performs poorly when applied to train networks on non-ideal analog hardware composed of resistive device arrays with non-symmetric conductance modulation characteristics. Recently we proposed a new algorithm, the Tiki-Taka algorithm, that overcomes this stringent symmetry requirement. Here we build on top of Tiki-Taka and describe a more robust algorithm that further relaxes other stringent hardware requirements. This more robust second version of the Tiki-Taka algorithm (referred to as TTv2) 1. decreases the number of device conductance states requirement from 1000s of states to only 10s of states, 2. increases the noise tolerance to the device conductance modulations by about 100x, and 3. increases the noise tolerance to the matrix-vector multiplication performed by the analog arrays by about 10x. Empirical simulation results show that TTv2 can train various neural networks close to their ideal accuracy even at extremely noisy hardware settings. TTv2 achieves these capabilities by complementing the original Tiki-Taka algorithm with lightweight and low computational complexity digital filtering operations performed outside the analog arrays. Therefore, the implementation cost of TTv2 compared to SGD and Tiki-Taka is minimal, and it maintains the usual power and speed benefits of using analog hardware for training workloads. Here we also show how to extract the neural network from the analog hardware once the training is complete for further model deployment. Similar to Bayesian model averaging, we form analog hardware compatible averages over the neural network weights derived from TTv2 iterates. This model average then can be transferred to another analog or digital hardware with notable improvements in test accuracy, transcending the trained model itself. In short, we describe an end-to-end training and model extraction technique for extremely noisy crossbar-based analog hardware that can be used to accelerate DNN training workloads and match the performance of full-precision SGD.},

In this context, this paper investigates inverse kinematics learning for resolved motion rate control (RMRC) employing an optimization criterion to resolve kinematic redundancies. Our learning approach is based on the key observations that learning an inverse of a non uniquely invertible function can be accomplished by augmenting the input representation to the inverse model and by using a spatially localized learning approach. We apply this strategy to inverse kinematics learning and demonstrate how a recently developed statistical learning algorithm, Locally Weighted Projection Regression, allows efficient learning of inverse kinematic mappings in an incremental fashion even when input spaces become rather high dimensional. The resulting performance of the inverse kinematics is comparable to Liegeois' analytical pseudo-inverse with optimization. Our results are illustrated with a 30 degree of freedom humanoid robot.},

A data-driven model is proposed for the prediction of the velocity field in a scramjet isolator by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using measurements of the pressure on the isolator. Numerical simulations of flow in a three-dimensional scramjet isolator at various Mach numbers and backpressures are carried out to establish the dataset capturing the flow mechanism over various operating conditions.

The CNN is trained using the computational fluid dynamics dataset to establish the mapping relationship between the wall pressure on the isolator and the velocity field in the isolator. The trained model is then tested over various Mach numbers and backpressures. The data-driven model successfully learns the relationship between the velocity field and pressure experienced on the wall of the isolator, i.e., the trained CNN model successfully reconstructed the velocity field based on the wall pressure on the isolator with high accuracy.},

In essence, a reduced-order model of the dynamics of the free surface motion of the fluid is developed under rigorous thermodynamics settings. This model is extracted from data by exploring several strategies. First, a linear one, based on the employ of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition techniques is analyzed. Second, a strategy based on the employ of Locally Linear Embedding is studied. Finally, Topological Data Analysis is employed to the same end. All the three distinct possibilities rely on a numerical integration scheme to advance the dynamics in time. This thermodynamically consistent integrator is developed on the basis of the General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible–Irreversible Coupling, GENERIC [M. Grmela and H.C Oettinger (1997). Phys.

We determined the velocity of nanometric acoustic waves in supercritical fluid argon at high pressures by inelastic X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a sharp transition on crossing the Widom line demonstrating how the supercritical region is actually divided into two regions that, although not connected by a first-order singularity, can be identified by different dynamical regimes: gas-like and liquid-like, reminiscent of the subcritical domains.

abstract = {Conventionally, the flow field over the hydrofoil is solved by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is a computationally expensive task. As an alternative, deep learning (DL) approximates the flow field without solving the complicated Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Consequently, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for hydrofoils performance prediction, which automatically detects fundamental features and accurately predicts the flow field of the hydrofoil. The CFD simulation is used to generate the dataset for neural network training and testing. The dataset containing hydrofoil geometry and operating conditions is fed into the CNN to approximate the model for predicting the flow field. Furthermore, we use novel attention gates (AGs) that concentrate on hydrofoils of different shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs not only learn to restrain unrelated features of the input information, but also emphasize significant features useful for flow field prediction. In addition, the effects of various hyperparameters of models on convergence have been extensively investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the flow field over a hydrofoil can be obtained within 0.5 s, with a mean relative error of less than 1.5{\%}.},

abstract = {The dynamics of turbulent flows is chaotic and difficult to predict. This makes the design of accurate reduced-order models challenging. The overarching objective of this paper is to propose a nonlinear decomposition of the turbulent state to predict the flow based on a reduced-order representation of the dynamics. We divide the turbulent flow into a spatial problem and a temporal problem. First, we compute the latent space, which is the manifold onto which the turbulent dynamics live. The latent space is found by a series of nonlinear filtering operations, which are performed by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). The CAE provides the decomposition in space. Second, we predict the time evolution of the turbulent state in the latent space, which is performed by an echo state network (ESN). The ESN provides the evolution in time. Third, by combining the CAE and the ESN, we obtain an autonomous dynamical system: The CAE-ESN. This is the reduced-order model of the turbulent flow. We test the CAE-ESN on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and the three-dimensional minimal flow unit. We show that the CAE-ESN: (i) finds a latent-space representation of the turbulent flow that has of the degrees of freedom than the physical space; (ii) time-accurately and statistically predicts the flow at different Reynolds numbers; and (iii) takes computational time to predict the flow with respect to solving the governing equations.

To speed up the computation, the transfer function theory is applied to create a surrogate transport forward model. The performance of the developed approach is evaluated on two case studies (literature and a new one) under different scenarios and measurement error conditions. The literature case study regards a heterogeneous confined aquifer, while the proposed case study was never investigated before, it involves an aquifer-river integrated flow and transport system. In this case, the groundwater contaminant originated from a damaged tank, migrates to a river through the aquifer. The approach, starting from few concentration observations monitored at a downstream river cross-section, accurately estimates the release history at a groundwater contaminant source, even in presence of noise on observations. Moreover, the results show that the methodology is very fast, and can solve the inverse problem in much less computation time in comparison with other existing approaches.},

abstract = {This work explores the physics-driven machine learning technique Operator Inference (OpInf) for predicting the state of chaotic dynamical systems. OpInf provides a non-intrusive approach to infer approximations of polynomial operators in reduced space without having access to the full order operators appearing in discretized models. Datasets for the physics systems are generated using conventional numerical solvers and then projected to a low-dimensional space via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In latent space, a least-squares problem is set to fit a quadratic polynomial operator, which is subsequently employed in a time-integration scheme in order to produce extrapolations in the same space. Once solved, the inverse PCA operation is applied to reconstruct the extrapolations in the original space. The quality of the OpInf predictions is assessed via the Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) metric from which the Valid Prediction Time (VPT) is computed. Numerical experiments considering the chaotic systems Lorenz 96 and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation show promising forecasting capabilities of the OpInf reduced order models with VPT ranges that outperform state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods such as backpropagation and reservoir computing recurrent neural networks [1], as well as Markov neural operators [2].},

Number fractions of gas-like and liquid-like particles are found to undergo continuous transition across the delta, following a simplified two-state model. These fractions are closely related to the magnitude of supercritical anomaly, which originates from the fluctuation between the two types.

In this study, two microscopic reconstruction methods, stochastic numerical and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction, are employed to generate 3D microstructure of two different types of GDL. The stochastic numerical reconstruction method simulates all available phases, including the pores, carbon fibers, binders, and PTFE, to generate the 3D microstructure of the GDL in comparison with experimentally obtained GDL using the XCT method. The porosity and pore size distribution of the reconstructed GDL are compared and analyzed. Pore scale model is employed to obtain the effective and anisotropic transport properties including gas diffusivity, electrical and thermal conductivity as a function of porosity caused by different compression strain. Furthermore, Lattice-Boltzmann method is used to determine the anisotropic liquid water permeability and saturation as a function of capillary pressure. The results show significant anisotropic transport properties of Toray GDL due to its disc-shape binder existed at the intersection of the fibers. On the other hand, Freudenberg GDL shows mostly isotropic transport properties due to its uniformly distributed carbon fiber without binder. The combined results not only provide a reliable framework for investigating GDL microstructure, but also provide useful property correlations for fuel cell simulations and operations.},

In this scenario, we investigate new data-driven approaches for the development of machine-learning augmented turbulence models. The main contribution of this work is providing a machine-learning oriented turbulence model that estimates directly the eddy-viscosity correction, and that does not require the use of additional transport equations. The configuration studied is a turbulent flow over a parametric set of bumps characterized by different levels of curvature, pressure gradient and flow separation. An artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained, cross-validated and tested to construct a mapping between the input features and the two quantities of interest: the eddy viscosity discrepancy and the true eddy viscosity estimated from the numerical database. We showed that the ANN predicts the eddy viscosity discrepancy with good accuracy but when coupled to a RANS solver, the improved solution is very noisy. On the other hand, when predicting the eddy viscosity directly, the ANN-based model successfully reproduce the general flow-field behavior, in terms of pressure and skin-friction distributions. The present methodology was proved to be robust even in predicting extrapolated flows. The methods and results of this work provide useful guidance for turbulence model developers.},

abstract = {A new model based on Landau theory is proposed that can quantitatively predict the density, isobaric specific heat capacity distortions of supercritical fluids. Unifying supercritical fluids into classical Landau gas-liquid transition theory, this model gives reasonable explanations for subcritical gas-liquid transition and critical/pseudo-critical phenomena. The results indicate that as inner fluctuations diminish away from the critical point, macroscale mean field approximations are valid, although microscale inhomogeneity exists. Based on the model, disputable pseudoboiling theory is reanalyzed. The thermodynamic stabilities of the supercritical and subcritical transitions are essentially different. Although transitions between the gas-like regime and liquid-like regimes exist, the separation and coexistence of these two regimes on a macroscopic scale never occur in supercritical fluids. For most applications, supercritical fluids can be regarded as single-phase fluids with anomalous properties. In the vicinity of the critical point, the classical description is invalid as the correlation length is on the macroscopic scale.},

abstract = {Time-resolved volumetric tomography (VT) has been applied extensively for turbulent flow/combustion diagnostics, due to its great capacity in reconstructing three dimensional scalar/vector fields. However, it usually suffers from high computational costs of conventional iterative methods in processing thousands of tomographic frames, and also the requirement of multiple high-speed camera/intensifiers to ensure sufficient spatial sampling, resulting in high experimental costs. In this work, we aim to take the full advantage of the recent progress in deep learning algorithms and develop an inversion method which not only reduces the processing time of a single frame down to the milliseconds level but also the number of projections required without sacrificing the imaging quality. Two distinct frameworks of convolutional neural network were designed and tested for VT reconstructions of turbulent flames for the first time. The results from proof-of-concept experiments implementing computed tomography of chemiluminescence (CTC) confirmed the feasibility of our method. Our data-driven approach can expedite the reconstruction process by a factor of ∼ 105 compared with conventional iterative methods (e.g., algebraic reconstruction technique). This work is expected to be valuable for all tomographic modalities which are seeking expedited reconstruction and reduced costs.},

The interpolation node selection procedure is formulated using the QR factorization with column pivoting, and it enjoys a sharper error bound for the DEIM projection error. Furthermore, for a subspace U given as the range of an orthonormal U, the DEIM projection does not change if U is replaced by U with arbitrary unitary matrix. In a largescale setting, the new approach allows modifications that use only randomly sampled rows of U, but with the potential of producing good approximations with corresponding probabilistic error bounds. Another salient feature of the new framework is that robust and efficient software implementation is easily developed, based on readily available high performance linear algebra packages.},

abstract = {Physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based methods have recently been applied to reconstruct the spatiotemporal wind field based on LIDAR measurements. However, the accuracy of this reconstruction considerably degrades when LIDAR measurement noise exists. Unfortunately, LIDAR measurement noise is inevitable in the real world. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel anti-noise method to reconstruct the wind field based on real-world noisy LIDAR measurements. To this end, we first address the gradient vanishing problem in PINN's automatic differentiation process, which prevents the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations from being fully leveraged in wind field reconstruction. This problem is addressed by proposing a residual-connected PINN (RC-PINN) framework. Its advantage in solving the gradient vanishing problem is mathematically proven. Subsequently, by incorporating the NS equations into the RC-PINN, an anti-noise wind field reconstruction method is established. The key feature of this method is that, by employing the RC-PINN, the NS equations are more effectively utilized in the training process, thus improving its anti-noise capability. The numerical results show that, at a wide range of noise levels, the proposed method can achieve a significant improvement in reconstruction performance. Especially, at the noise level of commercially available LIDAR, the reconstruction results are quite satisfactory. Moreover, the proposed method can converge faster.},

abstract = {Sparse linear estimation of fluid flows using data-driven proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis is systematically explored in this work. Fluid flows are manifestations of nonlinear multiscale partial differential equations (PDE) dynamical systems with inherent scale separation that impact the system dimensionality. Given that sparse reconstruction is inherently an ill-posed problem, the most successful approaches require the knowledge of the underlying low-dimensional space spanning the manifold in which the system resides. In this paper, we adopt an approach that learns basis from singular value decomposition (SVD) of training data to recover sparse information. This results in a set of four design parameters for sparse recovery, namely, the choice of basis, system dimension required for sufficiently accurate reconstruction, sensor budget and their placement. The choice of design parameters implicitly determines the choice of algorithm as either l2 minimization reconstruction or sparsity promoting l1 minimization reconstruction. In this work, we systematically explore the implications of these design parameters on reconstruction accuracy so that practical recommendations can be identified. We observe that greedy-smart sensor placement, particularly interpolation points from the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), provide the best balance of computational complexity and accurate reconstruction.},

They provide a global model of some metric of a design (such as weight, aerodynamic drag, cost, etc.), which can then be optimized efficiently. Engineering Design via Surrogate Modelling is a self-contained guide to surrogate models and their use in engineering design. The fundamentals of building, selecting, validating, searching and refining a surrogate are presented in a manner accessible to novices in the field. Figures are used liberally to explain the key concepts and clearly show the differences between the various techniques, as well as to emphasize the intuitive nature of the conceptual and mathematical reasoning behind them. More advanced and recent concepts are each presented in stand-alone chapters, allowing the reader to concentrate on material pertinent to their current design problem, and concepts are clearly demonstrated using simple design problems. This collection of advanced concepts (visualization, constraint handling, coping with noisy data, gradient-enhanced modelling, multi-fidelity analysis and multiple objectives) represents an invaluable reference manual for engineers and researchers active in the area. Engineering Design via Surrogate Modelling is complemented by a suite of Matlab codes, allowing the reader to apply all the techniques presented to their own design problems. By applying statistical modelling to engineering design, this book bridges the wide gap between the engineering and statistics communities. It will appeal to postgraduates and researchers across the academic engineering design community as well as practising design engineers.},

Using a supervised k-nearest neighbors regressor learning algorithm coupled with a Gaussian process, the framework predicts the mean flow and turbulent fluctuations by sharing the statistical features learned from experimental data. The capability of the ML framework is evaluated by comparing the flow dynamics of predicted trajectories to extensive Lagrangian particle tracking measurements under various flow conditions. Local velocity distributions, Lagrangian statistical analysis, solid concentration distributions, and phase flow numbers show very good agreement between ML-predictions and experiments. Being accurate, efficient, and robust, the ML framework is a powerful tool for analyzing and modeling multiphase flow systems using a minimal amount of driver data input, which can equally be provided from any reliable numerical simulation, thus avoiding costly experimental measurements.},

abstract = {CFD is now an essential tool for the design of all types of turbomachinery. However, as engineers are exposed more and more to the results of CFD and less and less to experimental data there is a danger that they may not realise the limitations of CFD and so will view its predictions as more reliable than they really are and not question them sufficiently. This is particularly dangerous when CFD is use as part of an optimisation procedure. The objective of this paper is to try to expose some of the limitations of CFD as used for routine turbomachinery design. CFD is not an exact science. Errors can arise from the following sources: • Numerical errors due to finite difference approximations. • Modeling errors, where the true physics is not known or is too complex to model - e.g. turbulence modeling. • Unknown boundary conditions, such as inlet pressure or temperature profiles. • Unknown geometry such as tip clearances or leading edge shapes. • Assumption of steady flow. Each of these sources of error is discussed and examples of the differences they can cause in the predictions are shown. Despite these limitations CFD remains an extremely valuable tool for turbomachinery design but it should be used on a comparative basis and not trusted to give quantitative predictions of performance. {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

abstract = {In contrast to traditional terascale simulations that have known, fixed data inputs, dynamic data-driven (DDD) applications are characterized by unknown data and informed by dynamic observations. DDD simulations give rise to inverse problems of determining unknown data from sparse observations. The main difficulty is that the optimality system is a boundary value problem in 4D space-time, even though the forward simulation is an initial value problem. We construct special-purpose parallel multigrid algorithms that exploit the spectral structure of the inverse operator. Experiments on problems of localizing airborne contaminant release from sparse observations in a regional atmospheric transport model demonstrate that 17-million-parameter inversion can be effected at a cost of just 18 forward simulations with high parallel efficiency. On 1024 Alphaserver EV68 processors, the turnaround time is just 29 minutes. Moreover, inverse problems with 135 million parameters - corresponding to 139 billion total space-time unknowns - are solved in less than 5 hours on the same number of processors. These results suggest that ultra-high resolution data-driven inversion can be carried out sufficiently rapidly for simulation-based “real-time” hazard assessment.},

This transformation, known as digitalization, is driven by the systemic integration of information technology in all kinds of devices, machines, and factories such that new smart networks are formed and new smart products have the ability to monitor, to forecast, and to control their behavior. One of the fundamental pillars of digitalization is simulation technology, since it enables the new intelligence layer in the form of digital twins which mirror the physical systems into the digital world - also named by Gartner Inc. as a top technology trend for 2017 and 2018. Creating such intelligence layers over several domains and life cycle phases requires, among other challenges, technologies for transforming and reducing complex simulation models. Exactly for this task a key technology is model order reduction (MOR). However, MOR is not only a key technology within emerging digital twins but also helps to reduce simulation times in the existing everyday business of simulation engineers. This is especially important when for a simulation model a large number of evaluations are needed. Within this chapter we present use cases where MOR is a key enabler for the realization of digital services and the reduction of simulation times. Furthermore we outline the potential of MOR in the context of realizing the digital twin vision.},

This study proposes a novel fault diagnosis approach for building energy saving based on the deep learning method which is deep belief network, and its application potential in the air conditioning fault diagnosis field is investigated. Then, a parameter optimization selection strategy is developed for model optimization. Four kinds of faults of the variable flow refrigerant system under heating mode are used to evaluate the performance of the models. The fault diagnosis results show that the deep belief network model with initial parameters can be used to diagnose the faults of the variable flow refrigerant system. Through the parameter optimization selection strategy, the fault diagnosis correct rate of the optimized model is 97.7{\%}, which is improved by 5.05{\%} compared with the model with initial parameters. The number of hidden layers of the deep belief network model is selected to be 2 layers. This result indicates that the fault diagnosis for variable flow refrigerant systems may not require a very deep model. Additionally, the performance of the optimized deep belief network model is compared with that of the traditional back propagation neural network, and the former is better. This finding also shows that the unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine layer for data feature reconstruction can improve the fault diagnosis performance.},

Written by authors with strong academic reputations and real-world practical experience, Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments is exactly the kind of treatment you need. The authors blend a sound, modern statistical approach with extensive engineering applications and clearly delineate the steps required to successfully model a problem and provide an analysis that will help find the solution. Part I introduces the design and modeling of computer experiments and the basic concepts used throughout the book. Part II focuses on the design of computer experiments. The authors present the most popular space-filling designs - like Latin hypercube sampling and its modifications and uniform design - including their definitions, properties, construction and related generating algorithms. Part III discusses the modeling of data from computer experiments. Here the authors present various modeling techniques and discuss model interpretation, including sensitivity analysis. An appendix reviews the statistics and mathematics concepts needed, and numerous examples clarify the techniques and their implementation. The complexity of real physical systems means that there is usually no simple analytic formula that sufficiently describes the phenomena.

This model, called VQM-VFD, uses perceptual features extracted from spatial-temporal blocks spanning fixed angular extents and a long edge detection filter. VQM-VFD predicts video quality by measuring multiple frame delays using perception based parameters to track subjective quality over time. In the performance analysis of VQM-VFD, we evaluated its efficacy at predicting human opinions of visual quality. A detailed correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing show that VQM-VFD accurately predicts human subjective judgments and substantially outperforms top-performing image quality assessment and VQA models previously tested on the LIVE mobile VQA database. VQM-VFD achieved the best performance on the mobile and tablet studies of the LIVE mobile VQA database for simulated compression, wireless packet-loss, and rate adaptation, but not for temporal dynamics. These results validate the new model and warrant a hard release of the VQM-VFD algorithm. It is freely available for any purpose, commercial, or noncommercial at http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/vqm/.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage could significantly reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. One of the major limitations of this technology is the energy penalty for the compression of CO2 to supercritical conditions. To reduce the power requirements, supercritical carbon dioxide compressors must operate near saturation where phase change effects are important. Nonequilibrium condensation can occur at the leading edge of the compressor, causing performance and stability issues. The characterization of the fluid at these conditions is vital to enable advanced compressor designs at enhanced efficiency levels but the analysis is challenging due to the lack of data on metastable fluid properties. In this paper, we assess the behavior and nucleation characteristics of high-pressure subcooled CO2 during the expansion in a de Laval nozzle. The assessment is conducted with numerical calculations and corroborated by experimental measurements. The Wilson line is determined via optical measurements in the range of 41-82 bar. The state of the metastable fluid is characterized through pressure and density measurements, with the latter obtained in a first-of-its-kind laser interferometry setup. The inlet conditions of the nozzle are moved close to the critical point to allow for reduced margins to condensation. The analysis suggests that direct extrapolation using the Span and Wagner equation of state (S-W EOS) model yields results within 2{\%} of the experimental data. The results are applied to define inlet conditions for a supercritical carbon dioxide compressor. Full-scale compressor experiments demonstrate that the reduced inlet temperature can decrease the shaft power input by 16{\%}.},

abstract = {This work utilizes data-driven methods to morph a series of time-resolved experimental OH-PLIF images into corresponding three-component planar PIV fields in the closed domain of a premixed swirl combustor. The task is carried out with a fully convolutional network, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) used in many applications in machine learning, alongside an existing experimental dataset which consists of simultaneous OH-PLIF and PIV measurements in both attached and detached flame regimes. Two types of models are compared: 1) a global CNN which is trained using images from the entire domain, and 2) a set of local CNNs, which are trained only on individual sections of the domain. The locally trained models show improvement in creating mappings in the detached regime over the global models. A comparison between model performance in attached and detached regimes shows that the CNNs are much more accurate across the board in creating velocity fields for attached flames. Inclusion of time history in the PLIF input resulted in small noticeable improvement on average, which could imply a greater physical role of instantaneous spatial correlations in the decoding process over temporal dependencies from the perspective of the CNN. Additionally, the performance of local models trained to produce mappings in one section of the domain is tested on other, unexplored sections of the domain. Interestingly, local CNN performance on unseen domain regions revealed the models' ability to utilize symmetry and antisymmetry in the velocity field. Ultimately, this work shows the powerful ability of the CNN to decode the three-dimensional PIV fields from input OH-PLIF images, providing a potential groundwork for a very useful tool for experimental configurations in which accessibility of forms of simultaneous measurements are limited.},

abstract = {Flow around cylinders is an important phenomenon in many different engineering fields. In this paper, the fast prediction of the pressure fields of parallel twin cylinders is implemented based on a data-driven algorithm. Firstly, the pressure fields of parallel twin cylinders with a low Reynolds number are obtained through the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The pressure fields at different time steps are collected to form a snapshot matrix. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) algorithm is then applied to obtain the POD basis vectors of the snapshot matrix, enabling the reconstruing the pressure fields. Subsequently, two reduced-order models (ROM) called the POD-RBFNN and POD-BPNN surrogate models are proposed in this paper. The POD-RBFNN surrogate model uses the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to train the POD mode coefficients obtained from the POD algorithm, while the POD-BPNN surrogate model uses the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) for the same purpose. Linearly combining the POD mode coefficients predicted by the POD-RBFNN or POD-BPNN surrogate models with the POD basis vectors obtained from the POD algorithm enables fast and efficient prediction of pressure fields for non-sample points. Finally, comparisons are made between the predicted pressure fields obtained from these two surrogate models and the actual values obtained through CFD simulations. It is found that both the POD-RBFNN and POD-BPNN surrogate models proposed in this paper not only significantly improve efficiency but also maintain a high level of accuracy. However, the training time of the POD-RBFNN surrogate model is significantly shorter than that of the POD-BPNN surrogate model. Additionally, the POD-RBFNN surrogate model exhibits smaller Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). For the data-driven model of parallel twin cylinders described in this paper, the POD-RBFNN surrogate model is more suitable to predict the pressure fields. The research results in this paper are believed to hold significant value for CFD calculations of parallel twin cylinder models, offering essential guidance for a deeper understanding of cylinder flow problems and optimizing engineering design.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be an efficient alternative approach to classical modeling techniques. AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail. Finally, potential research avenues and emerging trends for employing ML, PR, and DL are presented, and their limitations are discussed.},

abstract = {Three years of large-scale PDE-constrained optimization research and development are summarized in this report. We have developed an optimization framework for 3 levels of SAND optimization and developed a powerful PDE prototyping tool. The optimization algorithms have been interfaced and tested on CVD problems using a chemically reacting fluid flow simulator resulting in an order of magnitude reduction in compute time over a black box method. Sandia's simulation environment is reviewed by characterizing each dis- cipline and identifying a possible target level of optimization. Because SAND algorithms are difficult to test on actual production codes, a symbolic simulator (Sundance) was de- veloped and interfaced with a reduced-space sequential quadratic programming framework (rSQP++) to provide a PDE prototyping environment. The power of Sundance/rSQP++ is demonstrated by applying optimization to a series of different PDE-based problems. In ad- dition, we showthe merits ofSANDmethods by comparing seven levels of optimization for a source-inversion problem using Sundance and rSQP++. Algorithmic results are discussed for hierarchical control methods. The design of an interior point quadratic programming solver is presented.},

abstract = {Engineering design (ED) is the process of solving technical problems within requirements and constraints to create new artifacts. Data science (DS) is the inter-disciplinary field that uses computational systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data. The synergies between these two fields have a long story and throughout the past decades, ED has increasingly benefited from an integration with DS. We present a literature review at the intersection between ED and DS, identifying the tools, algorithms and data sources that show the most potential in contributing to ED, and identifying a set of challenges that future data scientists and designers should tackle, to maximize the potential of DS in supporting effective and efficient designs. A rigorous scoping review approach has been supported by Natural Language Processing techniques, in order to offer a review of research across two fuzzy-confining disciplines. The paper identifies challenges related to the two fields of research and to their interfaces. The main gaps in the literature revolve around the adaptation of computational techniques to be applied in the peculiar context of design, the identification of data sources to boost design research and a proper featurization of this data. The challenges have been classified considering their impacts on ED phases and applicability of DS methods, giving a map for future research across the fields. The scoping review shows that to fully take advantage of DS tools there must be an increase in the collaboration between design practitioners and researchers in order to open new data driven opportunities.},

abstract = {The supercritical region is often described as uniform with no definite transitions. The distinct behaviors of the matter therein, e.g., as liquidlike and gaslike, however, suggest "supercritical boundaries."Here we provide a mathematical description of these phenomena by revisiting the Yang-Lee theory and introducing a complex phase diagram, specifically a four-dimensional (4D) one with complex T and p. While the traditional 2D phase diagram with real temperature T and pressure p values (the physical plane) lacks Lee-Yang (LY) zeros beyond the critical point, preventing the occurrence of criticality, the off-plane zeros in this 4D scenario still induce critical anomalies in various physical properties. This relationship is evidenced by the correlation between the Widom line and LY edges in van der Waals, 2D Ising model, and water. The diverged supercritical boundaries manifest the high-dimensional feature of the phase diagram: e.g., when LY zeros of complex T or p are projected onto the physical plane, boundaries defined by isobaric heat capacity Cp or isothermal compression coefficient KT emanates. These results demonstrate the incipient phase transition nature of the supercritical matter.},

abstract = {Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows. To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field. In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations. We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90 {\%} agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response. We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one. In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies.},

abstract = {In recent years, the data-driven turbulence model has attracted widespread concern in fluid mechanics. The existing approaches modify or supplement the original turbulence model by machine learning based on the experimental/numerical data, in order to augment the capability of the present turbulence models. Different from the previous researches, this paper directly reconstructs a mapping function between the turbulent eddy viscosity and the mean flow variables by neural networks and completely replaces the original partial differential equation model. On the other hand, compared with the machine learning models for the low Reynolds (Re) number flows based on direct numerical simulation data, high Reynolds number flows around airfoils present the apparent scaling effects and strong anisotropy, which induce large challenges in accuracy and generalization capability for the machine learning algorithm. We mainly concentrate on the high Reynolds number turbulent flows around the airfoils and take the results calculated by the computational fluid dynamics solver with the Spallart-Allmaras (SA) model as training data to construct a high-dimensional data-driven network model based on machine learning. The radial basis function neural network and the auxiliary optimization methods are adopted, and the individual models are built separately for the flow fields of the near-wall region, wake region, and far-field region. The training data in this paper is extracted from only three subsonic flow fields of NACA0012 airfoil. The data-driven turbulence model can be applied to various airfoils and flow states, and the predicted eddy viscosity, lift/drag coefficients, and skin friction distributions are all in good agreement with the results of the original SA model. This research demonstrates the promising prospect of machine learning methods in future studies about turbulence modeling.},

A data-driven basis derived from diffusion kernels known in machine learning is employed here to represent a regularized generator of the unitary Koopman group in the sense of a Galerkin approximation. The resulting Koopman eigenfunctions can be grouped into subsets in accordance with the discrete symmetries in a cubic box. In particular, a projection of the velocity field onto the first group of eigenfunctions reveals the four stable large-scale circulation (LSC) states in the convection cell. We recapture the preferential circulation rolls in diagonal corners and the short-term switching through roll states parallel to the side faces which have also been seen in other simulations and experiments. The diagonal macroscopic flow states can last as long as 1000 convective free-fall time units. In addition, we find that specific pairs of Koopman eigenfunctions in the secondary subset obey enhanced oscillatory fluctuations for particular stable diagonal states of the LSC. The corresponding velocity-field structures, such as corner vortices and swirls in the midplane, are also discussed via spatiotemporal reconstructions.},

abstract = {The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool has a remarkable applicability for the prediction of gas dispersion flows by numerically solving the proper governing equations in realistic scenarios. Depending on the problem complexity, undesirably high computational costs can be incurred, which has encouraged the combined use of Machine Learning (ML) seeking to attenuate the CFD simulations requirement for multiple scenario studies. The present work aims at demonstrating the employment the coupling between CFD and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm for representative problems in atmospheric dispersion in a preliminary assessment. A limited set of CFD simulation results was used for training neural networks, whose output is given by flow field interpolators, the potential uses of which include digital twin designing and optimization procedures. One possible strategy is the local approach, which treats the network as a transition rule in the scope of Cellular Automata (CA) modeling, allowing it to learn the dynamic behavior of the addressed physics locally. This method gives rise to simpler neural network architectures with closer computing relatively to the CFD calculation. Assessments have been done by predicting, initially, a scalar field time evolution governed by a 1-D advection-diffusion transport equation to verify the method implementation. Subsequently, species concentration distributions were sought in atmospheric dispersion cases from CFD simulations datasets, comprising four case studies followed in the performed analysis, all considering a bidimensional flow domain and a scenario involving methane leaks. The first one indicated an accurate reproduction of subsequent time steps concentration field referring to the displacement of a methane cloud. The second and third cases concerned a plume formation, in transient and steady-state regimes, respectively; their main outcome was the evidence of the CA-ANN methodology's flexibility to address time-dependent and permanent flow simulations interpolation. The last CFD-based case study comprised an additional complexity feature of gas dispersion problems: the wind influence. By redesigning the investigated data-driven approach in terms of ANN's features and labels choice, promising results followed from the analysis with respect to the simultaneous capturing of two global simulation parameters (wind and leakage speeds boundary conditions) in the species concentration field interpolation.},

The $\beta$-variational autoencoder is trained to learn a compact latent representation of the flow velocity, and the transformer is trained to predict the temporal dynamics in latent-space. Using the $\beta$-variational autoencoder to learn disentangled representations in latent-space, we obtain a more interpretable flow model with features that resemble those observed in the proper orthogonal decomposition, but with a more efficient representation. Using Poincar{\'{e}} maps, the results show that our method can capture the underlying dynamics of the flow outperforming other prediction models.

abstract = {Flow state can be changed by multiple disturbances and uncertain factors in a complex flow environment, which calls for great interest to adjust the control law automatically to adapt to the changing flow environment. Model-based control can obtain predetermined control effects, but its adaptive ability is limited due to the modeling accuracy and unmodeled dynamics of the reduced-order model. To overcome these limitations, the data-driven adaptive control of transonic buffet flow based on the radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is carried out in this work. The actuator is the trailing edge flap, and the feedback signal is the lift coefficient. The historical input and output are used in the RBF-NN adaptive control to calculate the current control input from the neural network. When the flow state changes, the parameters of the neural network are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to make the system work in an optimal or a near-optimal state automatically. Results show that buffet loads can be suppressed completely by RBF-NN control, even if the freestream Mach number and the angle of attack change continuously [from (M, $\alpha$) = (0.7, 5.5°) to (M, $\alpha$) = (0.8, 1.5°)]. The control strategy proposed in this work only needs the historical response data of the flow field, and it shows little dependence on the low-order linear model of the system. Therefore, it can be applied to the unstable flow control, in which the low-order model of the flow is difficult to construct and automatically adapt to the changing flow environment.},

abstract = {For rotor design applications, such as wind turbine rotors or urban air mobility (UAM) rotorcraft and flying-car design, there is a significant challenge in quickly and accurately modeling rotors operating in complex, turbulent flow fields. One potential path for deriving reasonably accurate but low-cost rotor performance predictions is available through the application of data-driven surrogate modeling. In this study, an initial investigation is undertaken to apply a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based reduced-order model (ROM) for predicting rotor distributed loads. The POD ROM was derived based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results and utilized to produce distributed-pressure predictions on rotor blades subjected to topology change due to variations in the twist and taper ratio. Rotor twist, $\theta$, was varied between 0, 10, 20, and 30, while the taper ratio, $\lambda$, was varied as 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. For a demonstration of the approach, all rotors consisted of a single blade. The POD ROM was validated for three operation cases: a high-pitch or a high-thrust rotor in hover, a low-pitch or a low-thrust rotor in hover, and a rotor in forward flight at a low speed resembling wind turbine operation with wind shear. Results showed that reasonably accurate distributed-load predictions could be achieved and the resulting surrogate model can predict loads at a minimal computational cost. The computational cost for the hovering blade surface pressure prediction was reduced from 12 h on 440 cores required for CFD to a fraction of a second on a single core required for POD. For rotors in forward flight, cost was reduced from 20 h on 440 cores to less than a second on a single core. The POD ROM was used to carry out a design optimization of the rotor such that the figure of merit was maximized for hovering-rotor cases and the lift-to-drag effective ratio was maximized in forward flight.},

abstract = {Machine learning tools represent key enablers for empowering material scientists and engineers to accelerate the development of novel materials, processes and techniques. One of the aims of using such approaches in the field of materials science is to achieve high-throughput identification and quantification of essential features along the process-structure-property-performance chain. In this contribution, machine learning and statistical learning approaches are reviewed in terms of their successful application to specific problems in the field of continuum materials mechanics. They are categorized with respect to their type of task designated to be either descriptive, predictive or prescriptive; thus to ultimately achieve identification, prediction or even optimization of essential characteristics. The respective choice of the most appropriate machine learning approach highly depends on the specific use-case, type of material, kind of data involved, spatial and temporal scales, formats, and desired knowledge gain as well as affordable computational costs. Different examples are reviewed involving case-by-case dependent application of different types of artificial neural networks and other data-driven approaches such as support vector machines, decision trees and random forests as well as Bayesian learning, and model order reduction procedures such as principal component analysis, among others. These techniques are applied to accelerate the identification of material parameters or salient features for materials characterization, to support rapid design and optimization of novel materials or manufacturing methods, to improve and correct complex measurement devices, or to better understand and predict fatigue behavior, among other examples. Besides experimentally obtained datasets, numerous studies draw required information from simulation-based data mining. Altogether, it is shown that experiment- and simulation-based data mining in combination with machine leaning tools provide exceptional opportunities to enable highly reliant identification of fundamental interrelations within materials for characterization and optimization in a scale-bridging manner. Potentials of further utilizing applied machine learning in materials science and empowering significant acceleration of knowledge output are pointed out.},

abstract = {We illustrate an approach that can be exploited for constructing neural networks which a priori obey physical laws. We start with a simple single-layer neural network (NN) but refrain from choosing the activation functions yet. Under certain conditions and in the infinite-width limit, we may apply the central limit theorem, upon which the NN output becomes Gaussian. We may then investigate and manipulate the limit network by falling back on Gaussian process (GP) theory. It is observed that linear operators acting upon a GP again yield a GP. This also holds true for differential operators defining differential equations and describing physical laws. If we demand the GP, or equivalently the limit network, to obey the physical law, then this yields an equation for the covariance function or kernel of the GP, whose solution equivalently constrains the model to obey the physical law. The central limit theorem then suggests that NNs can be constructed to obey a physical law by choosing the activation functions such that they match a particular kernel in the infinite-width limit. The activation functions constructed in this way guarantee the NN to a priori obey the physics, up to the approximation error of non-infinite network width. Simple examples of the homogeneous 1D-Helmholtz equation are discussed and compared to naive kernels and activations.},

Data-driven modeling and scientific discovery is a change of paradigm on how many problems, both in science and engineering, are addressed. Some scientific fields have been using artificial intelligence for some time due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining laws and equations to describe some phenomena. However, today data-driven approaches are also flooding fields like mechanics and materials science, where the traditional approach seemed to be highly satisfactory.

abstract = {In many applications, it is important to reconstruct a fluid flow field, or some other high-dimensional state, from limited measurements and limited data. In this work, we propose a shallow neural network-based learning methodology for such fluid flow reconstruction. Our approach learns an end-to-end mapping between the sensor measurements and the high-dimensional fluid flow field, without any heavy preprocessing on the raw data. No prior knowledge is assumed to be available, and the estimation method is purely data-driven. We demonstrate the performance on three examples in fluid mechanics and oceanography, showing that this modern data-driven approach outperforms traditional modal approximation techniques which are commonly used for flow reconstruction. Not only does the proposed method show superior performance characteristics, it can also produce a comparable level of performance to traditional methods in the area, using significantly fewer sensors. Thus, the mathematical architecture is ideal for emerging global monitoring technologies where measurement data are often limited.},

abstract = {An improved nonintrusive parametric model order reduction (pMOR) approach is proposed for the flow field interpolation regarding fluid–structure interaction (FSI) objects. Flow field computation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) requires excessive computational time and memory. Nonintrusive and data-driven MOR schemes have been proposed to overcome such limitations. The present methodology is implemented by both proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and a modified Nouveau variational autoencoder (mNVAE). POD attempts to reduce the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) on the precomputed series of the full-order model parametric result. The reduced DOF yields parametrically independent reduced bases and dependent coefficients. Then, mNVAE is employed for the interpolation of POD coefficients, which will be combined with POD modes for parametrically interpolated flow field generation. The present approach is assessed on the benchmark problem of a two-dimensional plunging airfoil and the highly nonlinear FSI phenomenon of the limit cycle oscillation. The comparison was executed against other POD-based generative neural network approaches. The proposed methodology demonstrates applicability on highly nonlinear FSI objects with improved accuracy and efficiency.},

Basic principles of similarity are first used to derive scaling laws. Then, the analysis of typical specifications and the use of partial similarity (neglecting the Reynolds-number effects) allows the use of the pressure ratio-specific speed diagram so that a compressor can be scaled along its best-efficiency operating line. A practical method is proposed to use these scaling laws in a design context, in order to define the scaling potential of an existing stage as the ensemble of specifications that can be met by scaling. Finally, the scaling potential of an industrial compressor is evaluated and represented as a surface in the 3D space defined by the similarity variables, with the associated efficiency variations.

The resulting surrogate is able to generate physically accurate turbulent realizations at a computational cost magnitudes lower than that of a high-fidelity simulation. The deep generative model developed is a conditional invertible neural network, built with normalizing flows, with recurrent LSTM connections that allow for stable training of transient systems with high predictive accuracy. The model is trained with a variational loss that combines both data-driven and physics-constrained learning. This deep generative model is applied to non-trivial high Reynolds number flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations including turbulent flow over a backwards facing step at different Reynolds numbers and turbulent wake behind an array of bluff bodies. For both of these examples, the model is able to generate unique yet physically accurate turbulent fluid flows conditioned on an inexpensive low-fidelity solution.},

Three peak frequencies at St = 0.044, St = 0.17, and St = 0.59 were identified from field measurements of the vibration behavior. Subsequently, the unsteady flow fields in the control valve were determined from DES and then analyzed using the state-of-the-art data-driven proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method and cross-correlation analysis, which extracted the dominant unsteady flow behavior in relation to the valve spindle's vibrations. The findings demonstrated that the valve spindle's lateral force fluctuations at St = 0.019 occurred due to the alternating oscillations of the annular wall-attached jet, which resulted from the first two POD modes occupying 25{\%} of the turbulent fluctuation energy. The valve spindle's axial force fluctuations at St = 0.043 were attributed to the synchronous oscillations of the annular wall-attached jet, which resulted from the third, fourth, and fifth POD modes occupying 15{\%} of the turbulent fluctuation energy. Finally, through acoustic modal analysis that compared the pressure fluctuations extracted from the DES results, the axial acoustic mode in the valve's cavity at St = 0.19 was found to be associated with the valve spindle's axial force fluctuations at St = 0.174, while the first circumferential acoustic mode of the valve diffuser at St = 0.61 was found to be associated with the valve spindle's lateral force fluctuations at St = 0.62. This confirmed the potential coupling between the acoustic mode pattern and pressure fluctuation pattern. These complementary techniques were demonstrated to be effective methodologies for the flow-induced vibration behavior and intensive acoustics in valves.},

Because population-level equivalence between data and model cannot be shown with sample data, CFA should be viewed as a mainly disconfirmatory technique. That is, CFA facilitates the statistical rejection - or, at best, a tentative retention - of a specific theory regarding the factor(s) responsible for the observed relations in the data. If, on the other hand, the investigator's intentions are a mostly ungrounded exploration of relations suggested by the data, classical exploratory factor analysis is the more appropriate approach. In this article, typical steps in a CFA are introduced theoretically and via example: from model specification and identification, to parameter estimation, data-model fit assessment, and potential model modification.

abstract = {Data-driven decompositions are becoming essential tools in fluid dynamics, allowing for tracking the evolution of coherent patterns in large datasets, and for constructing low-order models of complex phenomena. In this work, we analyse the main limits of two popular decompositions, namely the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and we propose a novel decomposition which allows for enhanced feature detection capabilities. This novel decomposition is referred to as multi-scale proper orthogonal decomposition (mPOD) and combines multi-resolution analysis (MRA) with a standard POD. Using MRA, the mPOD splits the correlation matrix into the contribution of different scales, retaining non-overlapping portions of the correlation spectra; using the standard POD, the mPOD extracts the optimal basis from each scale. After introducing a matrix factorization framework for data-driven decompositions, the MRA is formulated via one-and two-dimensional filter banks for the dataset and the correlation matrix respectively. The validation of the mPOD, and a comparison with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), DMD and POD are provided in three test cases. These include a synthetic test case, a numerical simulation of a nonlinear advection-diffusion problem and an experimental dataset obtained by the time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) of an impinging gas jet. For each of these examples, the decompositions are compared in terms of convergence, feature detection capabilities and time-frequency localization.},

abstract = {In this work, a physics-informed deep learning model is developed to achieve the reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3-D) spatiotemporal wind field in front of a wind turbine, by combining the 3-D Navier–Stokes equations and the scanning LIDAR measurements. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is for the first time that the full 3-D spatiotemporal wind field reconstruction is achieved based on real-time measurements and flow physics. The proposed method is evaluated using high-fidelity large eddy simulations. The results show that the wind vector field in the whole 3-D domain is predicted very accurately based on only scalar line-of-sight LIDAR measurements at sparse locations. Specifically, at the baseline case, the prediction errors for the streamwise, spanwise and vertical velocity fields are 0.263 m/s, 0.397 m/s and 0.361 m/s, respectively. The prediction errors for the horizontal and vertical direction fields are 2.84° and 2.58° which are important in tackling yaw misalignment and turbine tilt control, respectively. Further analysis shows that the 3-D wind features are captured clearly, including the evolutions of flow structures, the wind shear in vertical direction, the blade-level speed variations due to turbine rotation, and the speed variations modulated by the turbulent wind. Also, the developed model achieves short-term wind forecasting without the commonly-used Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. Furthermore it is very useful in advancing other wind energy research fields e.g. wind turbine control {\&} monitoring, power forecasting, and resource assessments because the 3-D spatiotemporal information is important for them but not available with current sensor and prediction technologies.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is a cornerstone of the modern aerospace industry, providing important insights through aerodynamic analysis while reducing the need for expensive experiments and tests. A consistent spatial discretization on so-called grids approximates the analytical solution of the partial differential equation with increasing number of discrete points. But computing a rigorous amount of CFD simulations on fine grids can be a daunting task due to the high computational cost involved. Thus, it is of interest to find methods which generate accurate results while keeping computational costs low. This work proofs that machine learning as a post-processing tool is capable of improving the accuracy of coarse grid simulations. The results show that three machine learning models with varying complexity, namely random forest, neural network, and graph neural network, are capable of finding patterns in coarse grid simulations. These patterns are used for a vertex-wise prediction of the discretization error to approximate the field variables of interest of the corresponding fine grid simulation mapped onto the coarse grid. Initial training and testing is performed on the two dimensional RAE2822 airfoil leading to corrected flow fields, improved surface integrals and coefficients, even when shocks are present. Additional tests are performed on the RAE5212 airfoil, showing the generalization limits of the trained models. Finally, the training and prediction is showcased on a three dimensional geometry. The proposed method promises to reduce computational expenses while increasing the accuracy of the coarse grid results which works locally, e.g. it corrects the error for each vertex individually and is therefore not restricted by the number of grid points. The presented results obtained by the machine learning models during post-processing are a promising baseline for more integrated developments, where the models will interact in a dynamic fashion with the flow solver to further improve coarse grid simulations.},

Gradient computation becomes more precise and faster than the traditional finite difference method benefiting from the accurate and efficient automatic differentiation on the differentiable programming platform. Moreover, by setting the trainable weights of RNN as the material-related parameters, an inverse problem can be solved by training the network.

abstract = {A multiresolution formulation for the direct and inverse reconstruction of the heat flux from temperature sensors distributed over a multidimensional solid in an hypersonic flow is presented. The thermal response is determined by approximating the system Green's function with the Galerkin method and optimizing the heat flux distribution by fitting the distributed surface temperature data. Coating and glue layers are treated as separated domains for which the Green's function is obtained independently. Connection conditions for the system Green's function are derived by imposing continuity of heat flux and temperature concurrently at all interfaces. The heat flux is decomposed in a space-time basis where the temporal functions are multiresolution wavelet with arbitrary scaling. We develop quadrature formulas for the convolution product between wavelets and Green's function, a reconstruction approach based on isoparametric mapping of three-dimensional geometries, and boundary wavelets for inverse problems. We validate the approach against turbulent conjugate heat transfer simulations and wind tunnel experiments at Mach 0.8 and 6. The main findings are that multidimensional effects are important near the wedge shoulder in the short time scale, that the L-curve regularization must be locally corrected to analyze transitional flows, and that proper regularization leads to sub-cell resolution of the inverse problem.},

Moreover, the coefficient error scales linearly with the noise level, leading to high-accuracy recovery in the low-noise regime. Altogether, WSINDy combines the simplicity and efficiency of the SINDy algorithm with the natural noise reduction of integration, as demonstrated in [H. Schaeffer and S. G. McCalla, Phys. Rev.

The resulting equations of motion, which include these body-force terms, are cast in terms of conservative variables and are solved using a finite-volume time-stepping scheme. In the inverse mode, the swirl schedule in the bladed regions (i.e., the radius times the tangential velocity rVg) is the primary specified flow quantity, and the corresponding blade shape is sought after. In the analysis mode, the blade geometry is specified and the flow solution is computed. The advantages of this throughflow method compared to the current family of streamline curvature and matrix methods are that the same code can be used for subsonic/transonic/supersonic throughflow velocities, and the proposed method has a shock capturing capability. This method is demonstrated for designing a supersonic throughflow fan stage and a transonic throughflow turbine stage. {\textcopyright} 1997 ASME.},

In the two-compartment test cases 95{\%} of TCNN predicted temperatures and velocities were within ±17.2{\%} and ±0.30 m/s of FDS predictions. Although the model was trained and tested using a simple two-compartment configuration, the TCNN approach was validated with two more complex multi-compartment FDS simulations by processing each compartment individually. Overall, the flow fields in the multi-compartment validation tests agreed well with FDS predictions with 95{\%} of TCNN predicted temperatures and velocities within ±11{\%} and ±0.25 m/s of FDS predictions. Coupling a zone fire model with the TCNN approach presented in this work can provide spatially resolved temperature and velocity predictions without significantly increasing the computational requirements.

This system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. CMAQ was also designed to have multiscale capabilities so that separate models were not needed for urban and regional scale air quality modeling. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial scales, it has a "one- atmosphere" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community. To implement multiscale capabilities in CMAQ, several issues (such as scalable atmospheric dynamics and generalized coordinates), which depend on the desired model resolution, are addressed. A set of governing equations for compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheres is available to better resolve atmospheric dynamics at smaller scales. Because CMAQ is designed to handle scale-dependent meteorological formulations and a large amount of flexibility, its governing equations are expressed in a generalized coordinate system. This approach ensures consistency between CMAQ and the meteorological modeling system. The generalized coordinate system determines the necessary grid and coordinate transformations, and it can accommodate various vertical coordinates and map projections. The CMAQ modeling system simulates various chemical and physical processes that are thought to be important for understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions. The modeling system contains three types of modeling components (Models-3): a meteorological modeling system for the description of atmospheric states and motions, emission models for man-made and natural emissions that are injected into the atmosphere, and a chemistry-transport modeling system for simulation of the chemical transformation and fate. The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation.

In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process regression (GPR), a well-known nonparametric, and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. However, they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this article is devoted to reviewing state-of-The-Art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations that distillate the entire data and local approximations that divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations that modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations that retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations that exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

In this study, we propose a novel method for three-dimensional velocity reconstruction based on nonlinear acoustic ray tracing and tomography. The model provides the equation of acoustic ray motion in the flow field, which includes spatial and temporal parameters. During the process of measuring flow velocity, higher precision reconstruction of the three-dimensional velocity distribution was achieved by combining acoustic refractive paths based on derivative-free optimization iteration updates with radial basis functions that use Gaussian kernels. The computational time cost and reconstruction accuracy of the proposed algorithm were analyzed numerically and through simulations. The results indicate that the method incorporating acoustic ray tracing greatly improves the reconstruction accuracy of large gradient nonuniform flow fields. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of different numbers of sound tracing paths on reconstruction quality and computation time, providing a reference for the rational placement of microphones and the selection of the most efficient paths in boilers. Experimental results show that this method has good reconstruction capabilities for nonuniform flow fields and practical applications.},

abstract = {Wind load prediction is critical to the design of buildings, especially skyscrapers, because wind-induced dynamic loads and vibrations can often be a major concern that dominates the design. This paper presents a real-time wind load predictor for buildings by training an artificial neural network, with big data generated from a well-established software package for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), known as GSM-CFD. The cross-section of a building is idealized as a rectangle with various aspect ratios. The attack angles and velocity of the wind are also treated as variables in a wide range for building design considerations. We firstly establish a large number of computational models of major possible situations, and intensive computations using the GSM-CFD solver are conducted to generate detailed flow fields. Due to the high Reynold numbers of the flow fields, large eddy simulation (LES) model has been adopted in the calculation process. Both drag and lift coefficients are then computed based on the pressure distribution around the surface of the rectangular blocks. The GSM-CFD enables us to generate a mass of data considering different aspect ratios, wind velocities and attacking angles. Finally, an artificial neural network is trained to predict the drag coefficients for any given aspect ratios of the rectangular cross-sections of building subject to any given attack angles of wind with various velocities. The trained neural network is verified by comparing the results of the neural network predictions and that of the numerical simulations. The accuracy based on the test data set is found about 3.17{\%}, which is sufficient for engineering design purposes. Our trained neural network model is applicable to other problems with a flow around rectangles with aspect ratios from 0.2 to 1, air-flow velocity of 34 m/s, and attack angles from 0° to 90°. The prediction is practically in real-time.},

Using a supervised machine learning strategy, library elements encoding the dimensionally reduced dynamics are computed for various Reynolds numbers. Convex L1 optimization is then used with a limited number of pressure measurements on the cylinder to reconstruct, or decode, the full pressure field and the resulting flow field around the cylinder. Aside from the highly turbulent regime (large Reynolds number) where only the Reynolds number can be identified, accurate reconstruction of the pressure field and Reynolds number is achieved.

abstract = {A method capable of comparing and analyzing the spatio-temporal structures of unsteady flow fields has not yet been established. Temporal analyses of unsteady flow fields are often done after the data of the fields are reduced to low-dimensional quantities such as forces acting on objects. Such an approach is disadvantageous as information about the flow field is lost. There are several data-driven low-dimensional representation methods that preserve the information of spatial structure; however, their use is limited due to their linearity. In this paper, we propose a method for analyzing the time series data of unsteady flow fields. We firstly propose a data-driven nonlinear low-dimensional representation method for unsteady flow fields that preserves its spatial structure; this method uses a convolutional autoencoder, which is a deep learning technique. In our proposed method, the spatio-temporal structure can be represented as a trajectory in a low-dimensional space using the visualization technique originally proposed for dynamic networks. We applied the proposed method to unsteady flows around a two-dimensional airfoil and demonstrated that it could briefly represents the changes in the spatial structure of the unsteady flow field over time. This method was demonstrated to also be able to visualize changes in the quasi-periodic state of the flow when the angle of attack of the airfoil was changed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this method is able to compare flow fields that are constructed using different conditions such as different Reynolds numbers and angles of attack.},

The computation results reveal that mass ratio M∗, the angle between the centerline of two cylinders and the fluid flow direction $\alpha$, the reduced velocity U∗ and the ratio of the distance between the center lines of the two cylinders L∗ play key roles in the amplitude of the upstream cylinder and downstream cylinder. Subsequently, this study selected the above four parameters as input feature and trained two machine learning models to predict the amplitude of the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder, respectively. Three machine learning algorithms, namely decision tree regressor (DTR), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT), were tested.

abstract = {When learning simulations for modeling physical phenomena in industrial designs, geometrical variabilities are of prime interest. While classical regression techniques prove effective for parameterized geometries, practical scenarios often involve the absence of shape parametrization during the inference stage, leaving us with only mesh discretizations as available data. Learning simulations from such mesh-based representations poses significant challenges, with recent advances relying heavily on deep graph neural networks to overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning approaches. Despite their promising results, graph neural networks exhibit certain drawbacks, including their dependency on extensive datasets and limitations in providing built-in predictive uncertainties or handling large meshes. In this work, we propose a machine learning method that do not rely on graph neural networks. Complex geometrical shapes and variations with fixed topology are dealt with using well-known mesh morphing onto a common support, combined with classical dimensionality reduction techniques and Gaussian processes. The proposed methodology can easily deal with large meshes without the need for explicit shape parameterization and provides crucial predictive uncertainties, which are essential for informed decision-making. In the considered numerical experiments, the proposed method is competitive with respect to existing graph neural networks, regarding training efficiency and accuracy of the predictions.},

abstract = {Indoor airflow is one of the most critical factors affecting room comfort. The accurate prediction of indoor airflow fields is essential for efficient environmental control. However, representative methods for calculating indoor airflow organization, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), are complex and time consuming. Therefore, this study proposes a machine learning approach that can rapidly reconstruct indoor airflow fields. This method employs an improved deep operator network (DeepONet) and a Fourier neural operator (FNO) neural network to learn a set of solutions to a problem resembling a flow field and then realizes an accuracy-preserving prediction of an unseen domain. First, we decompose the computational domain into subdomains and then reconstruct the flow field for the subdomains. Subsequently, the subdomains are stitched into the original computational domain. Using data enhancement techniques along with a small dataset, this method achieves satisfactory training results. The results indicate that for a two-dimensional isothermal flow field problem, both the improved DeepONet and FNO models accurately reconstruct the flow field. The mean squared errors are 0.28{\%} and 1.89{\%} for the improved DeepONet and FNO models, respectively, with both requiring less than 0.01s. This method does not require repeated training under different operating conditions, which significantly reduces the computation time. Compared with conventional CFD technology, the proposed method improves the speed by up to three to six orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {The results of an experimental investigation of convective heat transfer from turbulent boundary layers accelerated under the influence of large pressure gradients in a cooled convergent-divergent nozzle are presented. The investigation covered a range of stagnation pressures from 30 to 250 psia, stagnation temperatures from 1030° to 2000°R, and nozzle-inlet boundary-layer thicknesses between 5 and 25 per cent of the inlet radius. The most significant unexpected trend in the results is the reduction in the heat-transfer coefficient, below that typical of a turbulent boundary layer, at stagnation pressures less than about 75 psia. As expected, the results include a maximum in the heat-transfer coefficient upstream of the throat where the mass flow rate per unit area is largest, and a substantial decrease of the heat-transfer coefficient downstream of the point of flow separation which occurred in the divergent section of the nozzle at the low stagnation pressures. A reduction of about 10 per cent in the heat-transfer coefficient resulted from an increase in the inlet boundary-layer thickness between the minimum and maximum thicknesses investigated. Heat-transfer predictions with which the data were compared either incorporate a prediction of the boundary-layer characteristics or are related to pipe flow. At the higher stagnation pressures, predicted values from a modification of Bartz's turbulent-boundary-layer analysis are in fair agreement with the data. As a possible explanation of the low heat transfer at the lower stagnation pressures, a parameter is found which is a measure of the importance of flow acceleration in reducing the turbulent transport below that typical of a fully turbulent boundary layer. {\textcopyright} 1964.},

The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni$\backslash${\~{}}no mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background.

Compared to conventional experimental characterizations, more structural features can be easily quantified using such 3D images in terms of geometrical descriptors. Therefore, we propose a machine learning and data-driven framework to identify an optimal descriptor subset for advanced characterization and accurate performance prediction of a porous material in a given application. Thus, targeted processing of the porous material can be realized. We investigate the permeability of porous materials for demonstration purposes. The descriptor selection step consists of two methods. The first method is the filter method, which involves importance ranking after inter-descriptor correlation-based instant screening from the entire set of descriptors using RReliefF and Kendall's tau. The second method is the wrapper method, which involves prediction-accuracy-based one-by-one selection and withdrawal from the previously screened descriptors using a support vector machine. Seven distinctive types of 528 porous media were digitally prepared, and their permeabilities were determined via CFD simulations. A total of 154 descriptors were evaluated via image processing. The proposed framework identified 11 descriptors and achieved more accurate prediction of the permeability compared to the existing correlations. Further, in the examined permeability range, the descriptors related to the pore size distribution allowed detection of flow channeling. These results effectively demonstrate the potential of the framework for the design and processing of porous materials by predicting their performance and hindered characteristics (e.g., channeling defects) from the identified descriptor subset in any application.},

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to predict the flowrate of multiphase flows for the first time and can achieve promising performance. In addition, considering the difference between data distributions of training and testing samples and its negative impact on prediction accuracy of the CNN models on testing samples, we propose flow adversarial networks (FANs) that can distill both domain-invariant and flowrate-discriminative features from the raw input. The method is evaluated on dynamic experimental data of different multiphase flows on different flow conditions and operating environments.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for learning a data-driven quadratic manifold from high-dimensional data, then employing this quadratic manifold to derive efficient physics-based reduced-order models. The key ingredient of the approach is a polynomial mapping between high-dimensional states and a low-dimensional embedding. This mapping consists of two parts: a representation in a linear subspace (computed in this work using the proper orthogonal decomposition) and a quadratic component. The approach can be viewed as a form of data-driven closure modeling, since the quadratic component introduces directions into the approximation that lie in the orthogonal complement of the linear subspace, but without introducing any additional degrees of freedom to the low-dimensional representation. Combining the quadratic manifold approximation with the operator inference method for projection-based model reduction leads to a scalable non-intrusive approach for learning reduced-order models of dynamical systems. Applying the new approach to transport-dominated systems of partial differential equations illustrates the gains in efficiency that can be achieved over approximation in a linear subspace.},

abstract = {The subgrid-scale stress (SGS) of large-eddy simulation (LES) is modeled by artificial neural network-based spatial gradient models (ANN-SGMs). The velocity gradients at neighboring stencil locations are incorporated to improve the accuracy of the SGS stress. The consideration of the gradient terms in the stencil locations is in a semi-explicit form so that the deployed artificial neural network (ANN) can be considerably simplified. This leads to a much higher LES efficiency compared with previous "black-box"models while still retaining the level of accuracy in the a priori test. The correlation coefficients of the ANN-SGMs can be larger than 0.98 for the filter width in the inertial range. With the current formulation, the significances of the individual modeling terms are transparent, giving clear guidance to the potential condensation of the model, which further improves the LES efficiency. The computational cost of the current ANN-SGM method is found to be two orders lower than previous "black-box"models. In the a posteriori test, the ANN-SGM framework predicts more accurately the flow field compared with the traditional LES models. Both the flow statistics and the instantaneous field are accurately recovered. Finally, we show that the current model can be adapted to different filter widths with sufficient accuracy. These results demonstrate the advantage and great potential of the ANN-SGM framework as an attractive solution to the closure problem in large-eddy simulation of turbulence.},

The axisymmetric flowfield is assumed to be inviscid, compressible, and rotational. The use of blockage and entropy-increase terms are included in the theory to model losses. An iterative procedure is presented for the calculations of the blade profiles which produce prescribed swirl schedules in the bladed regions. The numerical technique employed to solve the relevant equations is based on a finite-volume formulation.

abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a supervised machine learning framework for the non-intrusive model order reduction of unsteady fluid flows to provide accurate predictions of non-stationary state variables when the control parameter values vary. Our approach utilizes a training process from full-order scale direct numerical simulation data projected on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)modes to achieve an artificial neural network (ANN)model with reduced memory requirements. This data-driven ANN framework allows for a nonlinear time evolution of the modal coefficients without performing a Galerkin projection. Our POD-ANN framework can thus be considered an equation-free approach for latent space dynamics evolution of nonlinear transient systems and can be applied to a wide range of physical and engineering applications. Within this framework we introduce two architectures, namely sequential network (SN)and residual network (RN), to train the trajectory of modal coefficients. We perform a systematic analysis of the performance of the proposed reduced order modeling approaches on prediction of a nonlinear wave-propagation problem governed by the viscous Burgers equation, a simplified prototype setting for transient flows. We find that the POD-ANN-RN yields stable and accurate results for test problems assessed both within inside and outside of the database range and performs significantly better than the standard intrusive Galerkin projection model. Our results show that the proposed framework provides a non-intrusive alternative to the evolution of transient physics in a POD basis spanned space, and can be used as a robust predictive model order reduction tool for nonlinear dynamical systems.},

abstract = {To understand better equilibrium flows through supersonic nozzles, wall static pressures have been measured in nozzles with circular-arc throats having different ratios of throat radius of curvature to throat radius rc/rth, circular-arc or conical convergent sections, and conical divergent sections. These measurements were made with air at stagnation temperatures of 530° and 1500°R and over a stagnation pressure range from 45 to 250 psia. The flow through the transonic region was found to depend essentially on local configuration, i.e., on the ratio rc/rth; two-dimensional isentropic flow predictions agreed with the data in this region for the nozzles with rc/rth = 2.0, but were inadequate for the nozzle with rc/rth = 0.625. By comparison, the simple one-dimensional isentropic flow prediction was as much as 45{\%} high in the throat region for one nozzle; in the conical sections, deviations of a smaller magnitude were found. The effects of wall cooling and variation in the boundary-layer thickness at the nozzle inlet were investigated, as were differences in pressure readings with taps of various sizes. Some separation pressure data are presented to show the effect of wall cooling. Other flow features that indicate the extent of deviations from one-dimensional flow include flow coefficients, thrust ratios, and local mass fluxes. It is hoped that these comparisons between measurements and predictions will be useful in studying nozzle flows with the additional complexity of chemical reactions. {\textcopyright} 1965 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics provides boundary layer parameters near a trailing edge for an empirical wall pressure spectrum model, and then an acoustic model predicts far-field noise based on pressure fluctuations obtained from the wall pressure spectrum model. First, this numerical approach is validated against experiments. Second, a comprehensive trend analysis is conducted to give insight into the design of 3-D finlets under different flow conditions. A data-driven turbulence spanwise length scale model is developed to tackle finlets with small spacing. Combined with acoustic results, detailed computational flow field results are analyzed to understand the physical mechanism of noise reduction. While the major part of the proposed mechanism is the same as prior work, several new observations are shown which better understand the physical mechanism of noise reduction with 3-D finlets. The goals of the current paper are to provide an efficient Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based approach to predict trailing edge noise of 3-D finlets, to give complete trend analysis results with various finlets under different flow conditions, and to advance an understanding of the underlying physics.},

abstract = {In the past couple of years, there has been a proliferation in the use of machine learning approaches to represent subgrid-scale processes in geophysical flows with an aim to improve the forecasting capability and to accelerate numerical simulations of these flows. Despite its success for different types of flow, the online deployment of a data-driven closure model can cause instabilities and biases in modeling the overall effect of subgrid-scale processes, which in turn leads to inaccurate prediction. To tackle this issue, we exploit the data assimilation technique to correct the physics-based model coupled with the neural network as a surrogate for unresolved flow dynamics in multiscale systems. In particular, we use a set of neural network architectures to learn the correlation between resolved flow variables and the parametrizations of unresolved flow dynamics and formulate a data assimilation approach to correct the hybrid model during their online deployment. We illustrate our framework in a set of applications of the multiscale Lorenz 96 system for which the parametrization model for unresolved scales is exactly known, and the two-dimensional Kraichnan turbulence system for which the parametrization model for unresolved scales is not known a priori. Our analysis, therefore, comprises a predictive dynamical core empowered by (i) a data-driven closure model for subgrid-scale processes, (ii) a data assimilation approach for forecast error correction, and (iii) both data-driven closure and data assimilation procedures. We show significant improvement in the long-term prediction of the underlying chaotic dynamics with our framework compared to using only neural network parametrizations for future prediction. Moreover, we demonstrate that these data-driven parametrization models can handle the non-Gaussian statistics of subgrid-scale processes, and effectively improve the accuracy of outer data assimilation workflow loops in a modular nonintrusive way.},

abstract = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator-theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: (1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems; (2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big data and machine learning techniques; and (3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.},

In this paper, we present a novel data augmented Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), daGAN, for rapid and accurate flow filed prediction, allowing the adaption to the task with sparse data. The presented approach consists of two modules, pre-training module and fine-tuning module. The pre-training module utilizes a conditional GAN (cGAN) to preliminarily estimate the distribution of the training data. In the fine-tuning module, we propose a novel adversarial architecture with two generators one of which fulfils a promising data augmentation operation, so that the complement data is adequately incorporated to boost the generalization of the model. We use numerical simulation data to verify the generalization of daGAN on airfoils and flow conditions with sparse training data.

abstract = {Wind energy, which has many advantages, is in a stage of rapid development. However, because wind is sporadic and random, it is difficult to ensure a stable and efficient power supply, which poses risks to the security and stability of the power system. Therefore, research on short-term wind prediction is of great importance. Previous forecasting methods based on vectors or matrices have only been applied to wind velocity distributions in two-dimensional planes. If applied to multiple planes in three-dimensional (3D) space, these methods may not accurately reflect wind velocity distributions. To address this, we propose a novel method of wind forecasting: a tensor-based method that combines Tucker decomposition and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to rapidly reconstruct 3D wind velocity distributions. A fourth-order wind velocity tensor database under three terrains is established by CFD simulation, then dimensionality reduction and feature extraction are carried out on the database by Tucker decomposition. The coefficient tensors obtained by decomposition are used to rapidly reconstruct 3D wind velocity distributions. Wind fields are successfully reconstructed with good accuracy for direction angles ranging from 0° to 180° and inlet speeds ranging from 0 to 33 m/s. The influences of core tensor dimension, the number and distribution of sensors, and noise on reconstruction error are discussed in the error analysis. Ultimately, the proposed method is verified by anemometer values from a wind tunnel experiment. The minimum relative reconstruction error is 1.79{\%}. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct 3D wind velocity distributions in wind fields and is an innovative method of short-term wind forecasting.},

abstract = {We formulate a reduced-order strategy for efficiently forecasting complex high-dimensional dynamical systems entirely based on data streams. The first step of our method involves reconstructing the dynamics in a reduced-order subspace of choice using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR simultaneously allows for reconstruction of the vector field and more importantly, estimation of local uncertainty. The latter is due to (i) local interpolation error and (ii) truncation of the high-dimensional phase space. This uncertainty component can be analytically quantified in terms of the GPR hyperparameters. In the second step we formulate stochastic models that explicitly take into account the reconstructed dynamics and their uncertainty. For regions of the attractor which are not sufficiently sampled for our GPR framework to be effective, an adaptive blended scheme is formulated to enforce correct statistical steady state properties, matching those of the real data. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed method to complex systems including the Lorenz 96, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, as well as a prototype climate model. We also study the performance of the proposed approach as the intrinsic dimensionality of the system attractor increases in highly turbulent regimes.},

Recently, GAN-based techniques are shown to be promising for spatio-temporal-based applications such as trajectory prediction, events generation, and time-series data imputation. While several reviews for GANs in computer vision have been presented, no one has considered addressing the practical applications and challenges relevant to spatio-temporal data. In this article, we have conducted a comprehensive review of the recent developments of GANs for spatio-temporal data. We summarise the application of popular GAN architectures for spatio-temporal data and the common practices for evaluating the performance of spatio-temporal applications with GANs.

The tracing problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process with continuous state space and action space due to the spatio-temporal changes of environment. An long short-term memory-based reinforcement learning framework with full use of history information is proposed to generate a smooth strategy while the AUV interacting with the environment. Continuous temporal difference and deterministic policy gradient methods are employed to improve the strategy. To promote the performance of the algorithm, a supervised strategy generated by dynamic programming methods is utilized as transcendental knowledge of the agent. Historical searching trajectory's form and the exploration technology are specially designed to fit the algorithm. Simulation environments are established based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the effectiveness of the learned plume-tracing strategy is validated with simulation experiments.},

abstract = {Centrifugal compressors are used in many applications, including automotive turbochargers. Surge is an instability that occurs at low mass flow rates that is often damaging. Even mild surge produces noise characteristics that cause problems with customer acceptance. It is therefore important to be able to predict both mild and deep surge onset. In existing literature, models resulting in cubic-shaped compressor characteristics have been developed from first principles. This paper extends these to include diffuser recirculation and show a new quintic-like shape for compressor characteristics which, for the first time, can differentiate between mild and deep surge. These characteristics are incorporated into a model for an experimental facility and resulting simulations show remarkable fit to experimental data. The model allows for variations in both space and time, so simulations can capture wave dynamics in the pipework. The model captures: stable operation, mild surge, transition from mild to deep surge, deep surge, and the potential for a stable quiet period beyond the surge limit. Furthermore, the model can provide physical explanations for the surge dynamics observed. This combined with the model's predictive ability will be of help to turbocharger manufacturers during early design stages, prior to experimental tests or detailed CFD studies.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques for fluid flow modelling have gained significant attention in recent years. Advanced deep learning techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without prior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. However, most of existing researches focused mainly on either sequence learning or spatial learning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid flows (Reichstein et al., 2019). In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fluid model based on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) has been developed for predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions. In deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional flows can be converted into the low-dimensional “latent” representations. The complex features of flow dynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. The above DCGAN fluid model enables us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while maintaining a high computational efficiency. The performance of the DCGAN is illustrated for two test cases of Hokkaido tsunami with different incoming waves along the coastal line. It is demonstrated that the results from the DCGAN are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model (Fluidity). The spatio-temporal flow features have been represented as the flow evolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks can be captured accurately. In addition, the results illustrate that the online CPU cost is reduced by five orders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations. The promising results show that the DCGAN can provide rapid and reliable spatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear fluid flows.},

abstract = {Supercritical CO2 has been widely applied in power cycle owing to the exceptional physical property in the supercritical region. The Widom line is very important to reveal the pseudo-boiling mechanism of supercritical CO2 which plays significant influence on design and optimization of power cycle. In this paper, the Widom lines for supercritical CO2 in terms of thermodynamic response functions are constructed using equation of state (EoS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Different equations of state and CO2 models are proposed and applied to predict the various thermodynamic properties. The results show that the Peng-Robinson (PR) series equations of state play better performance in predicting the thermodynamic properties and the average absolute relative deviation is around 5.7 {\%} compared to the NIST database. The TraPPE model could represent a very good agreement with the experimental values at different pressures with about 1{\~{}}6 {\%} deviation. Owing to large temperature interval for molecular dynamics, the simulated values could not capture the dramatic change of thermodynamic properties at low temperature region (295 °C{\textless} T {\textless} 310°C), resulting in that the simulated thermodynamic properties by molecular dynamics are generally lower than that calculated by Peng-Robinson equation of state. When the temperature is larger 335 K, the deviation of Widom lines between the NIST and PR EoS decreases gradually with the temperature. Nonetheless, all the Widom lines could fall into the coexistence zone of liquid-like and gas-like phase which is surrounded by the isobaric temperature boundaries.},

abstract = {In this study, we address three important challenges related to disease transmissions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, namely, (a) providing an early warning to likely exposed individuals, (b) identifying individuals who are asymptomatic, and (c) prescription of optimal testing when testing capacity is limited. First, we present a dynamic-graph based SEIR epidemiological model in order to describe the dynamics of the disease propagation. Our model considers a dynamic graph/network that accounts for the interactions between individuals over time, such as the ones obtained by manual or automated contact tracing, and uses a diffusion–reaction mechanism to describe the state dynamics. This dynamic graph model helps identify likely exposed/infected individuals to whom we can provide early warnings, even before they display any symptoms and/or are asymptomatic. Moreover, when the testing capacity is limited compared to the population size, reliable estimation of individual's health state and disease transmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging. Thus, estimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk assessment, as well as for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing prescription. Therefore, we propose the use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification, to represent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This design enables us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and consequently optimize the testing as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a constrained testing budget. These tools can also be used to optimize vaccine distribution to curb the disease spread when limited vaccines are available. We present a few simulation results that illustrate the performance of the proposed framework, and estimate the impact of incomplete contact tracing data.},

abstract = {Feature identification is an important task in many fluid dynamics applications and diverse methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods are based on a physical understanding of the underlying behavior of the flow in the vicinity of the feature. Particularly, they require the definition of suitable criteria (i.e. point-based or neighborhood-based derived properties) and proper selection of thresholds. However, these methods rely on creative visualization of physical idiosyncrasies of specific features and flow regimes, making them non-universal and requiring significant effort to develop. Here we present a physics-based, data-driven method capable of identifying any flow feature it is trained to. We use convolutional neural networks, a machine learning approach developed for image recognition, and adapt it to the problem of identifying flow features. This provides a general method and removes the large burden placed on identifying new features. The method was tested using mean flow fields from numerical simulations, where the recirculation region and boundary layer were identified in several two-dimensional flows through a convergent-divergent channel, and the horseshoe vortex was identified in three-dimensional flow over a wing-body junction.},

The optimal control input is derived by online estimation of the value function through an additional NN-based forward-in-time estimation and approximated dynamic model. Novel update laws are developed for estimation of the identifier and value function online. The designed control policy can be applied using a finite number of actuators at the boundaries. Local ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is studied in detail using Lyapunov theory.

abstract = {Reduced order modeling (ROM) provides an efficient framework to compute solutions of parametric problems. Basically, it exploits a set of precomputed high-fidelity solutions—computed for properly chosen parameters, using a full-order model—in order to find the low dimensional space that contains the solution manifold. Using this space, an approximation of the numerical solution for new parameters can be computed in real-time response scenario, thanks to the reduced dimensionality of the problem. In a ROM framework, the most expensive part from the computational viewpoint is the calculation of the numerical solutions using the full-order model. Of course, the number of collected solutions is strictly related to the accuracy of the reduced order model. In this work, we aim at increasing the precision of the model also for few input solutions by coupling the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI)—a data-driven reduced order method—with the active subspace (AS) property, an emerging tool for reduction in parameter space. The enhanced ROM results in a reduced number of input solutions to reach the desired accuracy.

In this study, we tested various models of WM on a sample of 739 Italian children, ranging in age from 3 to 8 years, primarily of European heritage and from medium to medium–high socioeconomic background. Participants were assessed with 12 WM tasks, systematically varying the modality and level of executive control required (based on the number of activities to be performed at once: retention alone, ignoring distractors, and dealing with dual tasks). We examined younger children (n = 501, Mage = 56.8 months, SD = 6.4, 48{\%} boys) and older children (n = 238, Mage = 80.0 months, SD = 9.0, 58{\%} boys) separately using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. A Bayesian analytical approach was adopted. Our results suggested that a four-factor model distinguishing between verbal, visual, spatial–simultaneous, and spatial– sequential components of WM achieved the best fit. Overall, the WM structure was very similar in the two groups. We further explored this result with an additional model with a central executive factor loaded on high-control tasks only and found evidence for the presence of an executive control component. The contribution of this factor in terms of explained variance was only modest, however. Our findings demonstrate that it is important to distinguish between WM components in young children.},

The present work investigates the fidelity of such techniques applied to a stalled NACA 0012 aerofoil at at an angle of attack as measured experimentally using planar time-resolved particle image velocimetry. In contrast to many previous studies, the flow is absent of any dominant shedding frequency and exhibits a broad range of singular values due to the turbulence in the separated region. Several reconstruction methodologies for linear state estimation based on classical compressed sensing and extended POD methodologies are presented as well as nonlinear refinement through the use of a shallow neural network (SNN). It is found that the linear reconstructions inspired by the extended POD are inferior to the compressed sensing approach provided that the sparse sensors avoid regions of the flow with small variance across the global POD basis. Regardless of the linear method used, the nonlinear SNN gives strikingly similar performance in its refinement of the reconstructions. The capability of sparse sensors to reconstruct separated turbulent flow measurements is further discussed and directions for future work suggested.},

HODMD is a data-driven method generally used in fluid dynamics and in the analysis of complex non-linear dynamical systems modeling several complex industrial applications. In this paper we apply HODMD, for the first time to the authors knowledge, for patterns recognition in echocardiography, specifically, echocardiography data taken from several mice, either in healthy conditions or afflicted by different cardiac diseases. We exploit the HODMD advantageous properties in dynamics identification and noise cleaning to identify the relevant frequencies and coherent patterns for each one of the diseases. The echocardiography datasets consist of video loops taken with respect to a long axis view (LAX) and a short axis view (SAX), where each video loop covers at least three cardiac cycles, formed by (at most) 300 frames each (called snapshots). The proposed algorithm, using only a maximum quantity of 200 snapshots, was able to capture two branches of frequencies, representing the heart rate and respiratory rate. Additionally, the algorithm provided a number of modes, which represent the dominant features and patterns in the different echocardiography images, also related to the heart and the lung. Six datasets were analyzed: one echocardiography taken from a healthy subject and five different sets of echocardiography taken from subjects with either Diabetic Cardiomyopathy, Obesity, SFSR4 Hypertrophy, TAC Hypertrophy or Myocardial Infarction. The results show that HODMD is robust and a suitable tool to identify characteristic patterns able to classify the different pathologies studied.},

This work focuses on the large class of physical systems that can be well described by models with quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms and proposes a regularizer for operator inference that induces a stability bias onto learned models. The proposed regularizer is physics informed in the sense that it penalizes higher-order terms with large norms and so explicitly leverages the polynomial model form that is given by the underlying physics. This means that the proposed approach judiciously learns from data and physical insights combined, rather than from either data or physics alone. Additionally, a formulation of operator inference is proposed that enforces model constraints for preserving structure such as symmetry and definiteness in linear terms.

abstract = {In this paper, the subgrid-scale (SGS) force and the divergence of SGS heat flux of compressible isotropic turbulence are modeled directly by an artificial neural network (ANN), which serves as a data-driven SGS modeling tool for large-eddy simulations (LESs). The unclosed SGS force and divergence of SGS heat flux are modeled based on the local stencil geometry with Galilean invariance. The input features include the first-order and second-order derivatives of filtered velocity and temperature, filtered density, and its first-order derivative. It is shown that the proposed ANN-F7 model shows an advantage over the gradient model in the a priori test. Specifically, the ANN-F7 model gives larger correlation coefficients and smaller relative errors than the gradient model. In an a posteriori analysis, the ANN-F7 model performs better than the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and dynamic mixed model (DMM) in the prediction of the statistical properties of flow fields at the Taylor microscale Reynolds number Re$\lambda$ ranging from 180 to 250. The DSM and DMM models lead to the typical tilted spectral distribution of velocity, where low wave numbers are too energy rich, while those near the cutoff are damped too strongly. In contrast, it is shown that the velocity spectrum predicted by the ANN-F7 model almost overlaps with the filtered direct numerical simulation data. Besides, the ANN-F7 model reconstructs the probability density functions of SGS force and divergence of SGS heat flux much better than the DSM and DMM models. An artificial neural network with reasonable physical input features can deepen our understanding of turbulence modeling.},

abstract = {Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates, while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Therefore, both data from observations and ocean models lack information at small and fast scales. Methods are needed to either extract information, extrapolate, or upscale existing oceanographic data sets, to account for or represent unresolved physical processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and subsurface flow fields. As a proof of concept, we train convolutional neural networks on degraded data from a high-resolution quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks successfully replicate the spatiotemporal variability of the subgrid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalizing to a range of dynamical behaviors, and can be forced to respect global momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural networks can be subsampled to 10–20{\%} of the original size without a significant decrease in accuracy. We also show that the subsurface flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface (e.g., using only satellite altimetry data). Our results indicate that data-driven approaches can be exploited to predict both subgrid and large-scale processes, while respecting physical principles, even when data are limited to a particular region or external forcing. Our in-depth study presents evidence for the successful design of ocean eddy parameterizations for implementation in coarse-resolution climate models.},

abstract = {Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.},

The information flow between each part of the system is described and the importance of each stage in the calculation indicated. Information is transferred between programs via a data base which enables other design programs, e.g., heat transfer programs, to access the results. This modular approach enables individual design program advances to be made relatively easily. The system is flexible enough to incorporate a number of blade-to-blade programs, the one used depending on the specific application. An example of the flow through a turbine nozzle guide vane is presented. Experimental data are compared with the results from the quasi-three-dimensional system, a fully three-dimensional program and an unlinked two-dimensional system.

ML, especially deep learning and physics-informed ML, is a valuable toolkit that complements incomplete domain-specific knowledge in conventional experimental and computational methods. ML can provide flexible techniques to facilitate the conceptual development of new robust predictive models for multiphase flows and reactors by finding hidden pattern/information/mechanism in a data set. Due to such emergence, we thereby comprehensively survey, explore, analyze, and discuss key advancements of recent ML applications to hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and reactions in single-phase and multiphase flow systems from different aspects: (1) development of multiphase closure models of drag force, turbulence stresses and heat/mass transfer to improve the accuracy and efficiency of typical CFD simulations; (2) image reconstruction, regime identification, key parameter predictions, and optimization of multiphase flow and transport fields; (3) reaction kinetics modeling (e.g., predictions of reaction networks, kinetic parameters, and species production) and reaction condition optimization. These sections also discuss and analyze the key advantages and weakness of ML for solving the problems in the domain of multiphase flows and reactors. Finally, we summarize the under-solving challenges and opportunities in order to identify future directions that would be useful for the research community. Future development and study of multiphase flows and reactors are envisaged to be accelerated by ML and data science.},

abstract = {In this article, we propose an unsteady data-driven reduced order model (ROM) (surrogate model) for predicting the velocity field around an airfoil. The network model applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the encoder and a deconvolutional neural network (DCNN) as the decoder. The model constructs a mapping function between temporal evolution of the pressure signal on the airfoil surface and the surrounding velocity field. For improving the model performance, the input matrix is designed to further incorporate the information of the Reynolds number, the geometry of the airfoil, and the angle of attack. The DCNN works as the decoder for better reconstructing the spatial and temporal information of the features extracted by the CNN encoder. The training and testing datasets of flow fields under different conditions are obtained by solving the Navier-Stokes equations using the computational fluid dynamics method. After model training, the neural network based ROM shows accurate and dramatically fast predictions on the flow field of the testing dataset with extended angles of attack and Reynolds numbers. According to the current study, the neural network-based ROM has exhibited attractive potentials on ROM of the unsteady fluid dynamic problem, and the model can potentially serve on investigating flow control or optimization problems in the future.},

@article{banutiCrossing2015,
abstract = {Recent publications in the open literature have shown that supercritical fluid states are not homogeneously distributed but, in fact, can be differentiated into two distinct regions with gas-like and liquid-like properties, respectively. These regions are divided by an extension of the coexistence line, commonly called Widom line. This paper shows that a supercritical analog to subcritical phase change, pseudoboiling, does exist when crossing this demarcation. The supercritical state transition does not occur in a phase equilibrium but takes place over a finite temperature interval. While subcritical vaporization requires energy to overcome intermolecular attraction, supercritical state transitions additionally require energy to increase the temperature. It could be shown that the attractive potential is the dominant energy sink up to a reduced pressure of 1.5 for argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and water. The effect reduces with growing pressure and becomes negligible for p/pcr {\textgreater} 3. Furthermore, a new equation for this Widom- or pseudoboiling-line is given. It exhibits improved accuracy over previously published equations; performing a limit analysis of the Clapeyron equation allows to express its sole parameter purely in terms of thermodynamic variables. This parameter can then be evaluated from an equation of state or from fluid data - no nonphysical fitting is required.},

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been proved to be a suitable tool to predict the swirling flow pattern in such a separator device. Although CFD can be very accurate, the computational resources involved in these simulations restrict its use. In this sense, this work proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) as a data-driven reduced-order model that respects the flow field behavior and the mass and momentum conservations from the Navier-Stokes Equations. The results show that PINN can capture the complex flow behavior from both velocity and pressure fields. In PINN, momentum conservation is used as output in the training step and respected the same specified tolerance in the simulations. The PINN model's mass conservation presented the same order of magnitude of the CFD simulations in 96{\%} of the mesh. From our results, one can see that the PINN models are in good agreement with the experimental data and the CFD simulations, with the advantage of being 200 times faster than the CFD simulation.},

abstract = {Appropriate air supply system controller is of great significance to improve the performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Most of controllers rely on the high-precision, simple, and interpretable model. It is particularly important to establish the model for the fuel cell air supply system. Since the high-precision physically interpretable control-oriented model can provide an understanding of the underlying phenomena apart from computational tractability for aerodynamic problems. Data-driven sparse identification based on auto-encoder method is proposed to establish the model. It can be divided into the four steps. Firstly, collect data from a simulation model and the actual fuel cell system, and auto-encoder network is used to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space. Secondly, dictionary library is constructed from candidate terms based on system analysis. Thirdly, air supply model reconstruction problem is transformed into a sparse identification problem. Finally, the developed model is verified by two datasets. Compared with other methods, the results show that mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the three variables for proposed method are the smallest under both simulation data and real data. And the reconstruction results perfectly agree with the original simulation and the real data. Especially, the proposed method can be easily extended to other system modeling studies, such as the hydrogen supply system model and thermal management system model of the fuel cell system.},

With the proliferation of metamodeling techniques developed to provide enhanced performance for specific problems, and the wide availability of a diverse choice of tools in engineering software packages, the engineering task of selecting a robust metamodeling technique for practical problems is still a challenge. This research introduces a framework for describing the typology of engineering problems, in terms of dimensionality and complexity, and the modelling conditions, reflecting the noisiness of the signals and the affordability of sample sizes, and on this basis presents a systematic evaluation of the performance of frequently used metamodeling techniques. A set of metamodeling techniques, selected based on their reported use for engineering problems (i.e. Polynomial, Radial Basis Function, and Kriging), were systematically evaluated in terms of accuracy and robustness against a carefully assembled set of 18 test functions covering different types of problems, sampling conditions and noise conditions. A set of four real-world engineering case studies covering both computer simulation and physical experiments were also analysed as validation tests for the proposed guidelines. The main conclusions drawn from the study are that Kriging model with Mat{\'{e}}rn 5/2 correlation function performs consistently well across different problem types with smooth (i.e. not noisy) data, while Kriging model with Mat{\'{e}}rn 3/2 correlation function provides robust performance under noisy conditions, except for the very high noise conditions, where the Kriging model with nugget appears to provide better models. These results provide engineering practitioners with a guide for the choice of a metamodeling technique for problem types and modelling conditions represented in the study, whereas the evaluation framework and benchmarking problems set will be useful for researchers conducting similar studies.},

We start with an overview of a variety of nonlinear system identification techniques, namely, SINDy, weak-SINDy, and the occupation kernel method. Under the assumption that the dynamics are a finite linear combination of a set of basis functions, these methods establish a linear system to recover coefficients. We illuminate the structural similarities between these techniques and establish a projection property for the weak-SINDy technique. Following the overview, we analyze the error of surrogate models generated by a simplified version of weak-SINDy. In particular, under the assumption of boundedness of a composition operator given by the solution, we show that (i) the surrogate dynamics converges towards the true dynamics and (ii) the solution of the surrogate model is reasonably close to the true solution. Finally, as an application, we discuss the use of a combination of weak-SINDy surrogate modeling and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to build a surrogate model for partial differential equations (PDEs).},

Though many surrogate methods were proposed to alleviate the costs of these traditional approaches, most of them can only calculate the low-dimensional aerodynamic performance, and is not able to provide the accurate prediction of transonic flow fields for supercritical airfoils. Since the flow fields are equipped with its own discipline as a physical system in fluid dynamics, it is therefore possible to learn this discipline via data-driven machine learning approaches. Deep learning is witness to expansive growth into diverse applications due to its immense ability to extract essential features from complicated physical systems. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a recent popular method in deep leaning are capable of efficiently capturing the distribution of training data. In this work, we proposed a surrogate model, ffsGAN, which leverage the property of GANs combined with convolution neural networks (CNNs) to directly establish a one-to-one mapping from a parameterized supercritical airfoil to its corresponding transonic flow field profile over the parametric space. Compared with the most existing surrogate models, the ffsGAN is superior in efficiently and accurately predicting the high-dimensional flow field rather than the low-dimensional aerodynamic characteristics. The ffsGAN method is first trained using 500 airfoils that sampled based on RAE2822. The flow fields are then predicted for unseen airfoils to evaluate the generalization of the model in terms of prediction accuracy. An investigation of the effects of various hyper-parameters in the network architectures and loss functions is performed. The experimental results show that ffsGAN is a promising tool for rapid evaluation of detailed aerodynamic performance. The elaborate flow field predicted by ffsGAN is possible to be considered in airfoil design to further improve the design and optimization quality in the future.},

abstract = {Inferring the source information of greenhouse gases, such as methane, from spatially sparse sensor observations is an essential element in mitigating climate change. While it is well understood that the complex behavior of the atmospheric dispersion of such pollutants is governed by the Advection-Diffusion equation, it is difficult to directly apply the governing equations to identify the source location and magnitude (inverse problem) because of the spatially sparse and noisy observations, i.e., the pollution concentration is known only at the sensor locations and sensors sensitivity is limited. Here, we develop a multi-task learning framework that can provide high-fidelity reconstruction of the concentration field and identify emission characteristics of the pollution sources such as their location, emission strength, etc. from sparse sensor observations. We demonstrate that our proposed framework is able to achieve accurate reconstruction of the methane concentrations from sparse sensor measurements as well as precisely pin-point the location and emission strength of these pollution sources.},
